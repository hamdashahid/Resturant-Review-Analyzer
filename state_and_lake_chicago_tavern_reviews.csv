Heather,Dined 3 days ago,"State & Lake was recommended to us and reviews looked great so we made a reservation, and it was fine, but it wasn't super memorable. Service was just okay - we had to ask for coffee several times, no one checked on us after food was delivered, one of the items on our order was not as expected, and we didn't really get any guidance, and because no one checked back we were never really able to ask or order more to amend what we received. We waited too long for our check and the whole experience was just sort of ""meh"". Food DID arrive really quickly and the restaurant is pretty and cozy. I ordered the Egg Bake and it was good, but the menu says ""spicy sausage crumbles"" -- it's chorizo! I was expecting spicy breakfast sausage and probably would have ordered something different with an accurate menu description. I would probably not go back based on the experience and would say for anyone looking to book breakfast (that is not staying at this hotel), you might want to look for other options!

Anna,"Dined on November 30, 2024","Food was sub par.  Expensive for what you get. Limited menu. Money sandwich was cold. Like from the fridge cold. My husband did not get his toast with eggs and bacon even after we mentioned it, until after meal was finished.  And not buttered  His breakfast was runny eggs, mushy potatoes, raw bacon. The kids meal came with pancakes only. Nothing else. No whip cream. No side very  plain. One side wasn’t even  cooked well , other side was burned.  They did comp us for that one.  The first pancakes had syrup spilled all over. They took them back and then recieved the burnt ones. Had to ask for syrup, and butter which arrived frozen and unable to  spread.  Refills were never offered on coffee, water or juice. Even though they did not look super duper busy. Our server was very nice and apologized.  He was a nice man.  Had to ask for toast, syrup, butter, refills, and straws. Convenient location near the Chicago theatre and Macys.  Go through the WIT hotel which was decorated for holidays beautifully.  The tree is amazing.  Had reservations and said with little kids but  had to wait for a non high top. I would not go here again. Pricey for what you get and zero presentation. If you just want an egg I guess it’s fine.

Roger,"Dined on November 29, 2024","We went for the Thanksgiving dinner which had a special menu. We chose the prime rib and it was very good. They so had great deserts. We were glad to have such a nice place to eat Thanksgiving dinner together while traveling. Reservations were required for this dinner. We came in early to have drinks, but they were able to seat us right away. The “Bootlegger” bourbon drink was very good.

CalvinB,"Dined on November 29, 2024","The dining experience at State & Lake could be much better! Salad bar was very good... Fresh greens and good variety. The entrees were mediocre at best.  The prime rib was barely warm; Even after sending it back the meat was still barely warm, poorly/totally unseasoned. I ordered meat medium well, came back the second time medium RARE... I ate around the raw parts... The mashed potatoes were clearly from a BOX, and tasted like it. The asparagus SPRIGS were almost charred...  For a Thanksgiving meal this left MUCH to be desired!  The staff was EXEMPLARY! ... Very polite, the manager on duty did apologize for the food not being hot/satisfactory and offered complimentary glasses of wine. I appreciated that VERY much! Doubt if I'll be returning and won't be recommending this restaurant! So sorry!

Jinni,"Dined on November 28, 2024","Thanksgiving menu review - Good customer service experience, we were sat early for our reservation. But the prefix menu was inaccurate and misleading. The “seafood bar” was a depressing shrimp salad and some lox salmon, and the menu didn’t mention asparagus coming with the prime rib and if I had known that was the case I would have asked if there were any alternatives. Overall just not worth the price, I could have gotten an a full sized prime rib for $20 less at a number of places downtown.

ClassicTaste,"Dined on July 20, 2024","I really wanted to like this restaurant. It’s directly across the street from the Chicago Theatre (where we had tix for the America “Ride On” rock concert), and I was hoping for a cool ‘Chicago’ experience. Found nearly the opposite unfortunately.

1. No ambiance: The Tavern was screamingly loud. My friend and I fortunately were seated against a wall, but even though we were ‘kitty-corner,’ we literally had to shout at each other to carry on our conversation.

2) The food was over-priced for its value. We shared 3 appetizers: a shrimp cocktail, a cup of mushroom soup, and an appetizer-sized salad w grilled chicken. Nothing to drink but water (I.e. no cocktails or wine.) Cost was $48!! I mean, the food was decent but nothing creative—very ordinary. And it was $48 (not including tip) for just appetizers?!?!?

3) Our server was competent but not at all welcoming. No effort was made to be upbeat or engaging. She did her job but with the bare minimum of words of interaction with us.

Overall, we had a quick overpriced bite before the concert. I think I’d’ve been happier at ‘Steak and Shake’ instead of ‘State and Lake.’

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 4, 2024","We ate there before a show, so we had reservations ahead of the usual dinner rush. We were seated early, and the restaurant certainly started to fill up about 15min after we got there. Our server was quick and accurate. He even tried to see if the kitchen could split our dishes (we were sharing). They didn't do it (not a huge issue at all), so he brought us extra plates in advance. The food was excellent! Highly recommend the roasted Brussels sprouts with dates. The chicken breast with bacon bread pudding and apple reduction was phenomenal. The sauce was almost like they had liquefied a caramel apple.  Our drinks were good if a bit on the higher price side, but that is to be expected given the locations. All in all, we would definitely eat there again and certainly recommend it to others. If you have a show at the Nederlander, this is also a great location since it's a little over a block away.

ChrisB,"Dined on March 31, 2024","The resturant is inside the Wit Hotel.Ambiance is nice, live music friday and saturday. Service was great. Bilingual, polite. Prices are average for the type of place, I feel they could offer something extra to the guest staying to motivate traffic because Chicago has too many places to offer great food and ambiance.
But the sad part was the food. It was blunt, tasteless, good quality proteins but underseasoned and the menu was bit limited. Also few side options. We ordered 4 different proteins, 4 different options,4 different sides and not 1 was good. It was ok, it was bearable but for over $30/plate you would expect great taste.

Rena,"Dined on March 17, 2024","We arrived only to find out that we’re having a special menu that day. Which didn’t work with my diet, but it was a Saturday in Chicago—no one has availability. Our waiter ignored us for most of our time there. We had to flag down other waiters to get what we needed. The food was flavorless—although I will given them props for the creativity of the dishes—they just fell flat flavor-wise. They were also out of 2 of the 3 drinks from their special menu. All in all, it’s not worth the time or money. The DJ was good, but it’s too small of a space for that sound system.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 9, 2024","We dine here often if we have tix around the corner at Chicago Theatre, this time was a bit of a miss.  While we were halfway into our appetizer the entrees arrived - far too quickly.  One entree was the potato gnocchi dish, and this was the first time I have ever sent back food, as the gnocchi itself was like the consistency of of a just opened pillsbury can, that could be smeared across the side of the plate.  Server Jasmine was apologetic (not her fault), and new dish (completely different) came out quickly.  The addition of large (40ish”?) flat screen TV’s directly above the chair line along the walls (if your dining partner was against the wall across from you the tv would literally be right behind them shoulder height) seems like an odd choice, evidently they’re trying to maximize filing sports fans in..?  FYI If you have 7p show tix, the place starts filling up pretty quickly at about 5:45-6.

JBMW,"Dined on January 28, 2024","Three of us came here for dinner last Saturday night prior to attending a show at a nearby theater. We were seated and quickly ordered both our drinks and meals within five minutes to ensure timely arrival of our order. While we promptly received our drinks, after waiting nearly an hour, we never received our food. When we inquired multiple times, the waitress dismissed us and rudely said “your food will be here soon”. When we reminded her that we were going to a show, she rolled her eyes and sarcastically said “I know”. Since our food never arrived, we asked for the bill for our drinks. The waitress threw the bill on our table and walked away. Two of us had previously dined here and had a great experience. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. There was such poor communication and an utter lack of respect. Appalling.

Had to wolf down main dish that arrived 1:25 after we sat down because we were catching a show at a theater nearby.  Plenty of waitstaff walking around the restaurant but not being overly attentive to their tables. Watched most stand around chatting with each other.  Kitchen was completely overwhelmed. Could not accommodate a mostly full restaurant.  Would recommend eating here but to do it during off peak hours otherwise it takes forever.

Ordered our food at 6pm letting the waitress know we had a 7:30 show. Did not receive our food until after 7pm. Had to eat our food quickly in order to make our show. The table next to us ordered at the same time we did (their reservation was at 5:15). They had a 7pm show and ended up leaving at 7pm without ever getting their food. Others (smaller groups) who came after us, were seated in the area by the bar and were finished eating before we even received our food. Not sure if it was a server problem, kitchen problem or both. We did receive a discount on our food, but it was not a good experience. Couldn’t even enjoy the food because we had to eat it so quickly. We will be finding a different place to eat next time we go to a show.

DebraW,"Dined on January 20, 2024","Convenient to Chicago theatre which is why we chose to eat here. Very cold evening. Busboys were very very good. Food was okay and came out in timely manner. Servers were inattentive. We came early at 5:00 and the restaurant was not busy. We had to flag down  an employee for service although they had taken notice of us, no one approached us. We asked  politely who our server was and she said “I can be your server”. It appeared as if they did not know who was responsible for what tables. After that we were constantly looking for service. Hostess stepped up to get us utensils and drink order. Overheard the table next to us ask server if the food was coming as they had to make a show. Had already been waiting awhile. When food still hadn’t appeared, he said to his wife we have to go. He was quite unhappy and told the server to  cancel his order. Overall ok food, very convenient to theatre, great busboys but a tedious dining experience due to service.

KristinJ,"Dined on December 2, 2023","Food was great. However, we were sat at a table next to the bar, and the entire night, the young male bartender was joking around with other staff, using vulgar language very loudly. Saying things such as ""F you."" ""Get the F out of here"". It's not the swearing that I mind, but it was very inappropriate behavior in public for restaurant staff. We also had a friend call the restaurant trying to buy our group a round of drinks, and whom ever he spoke to, would not allow him to do so. Service could have been much better. Probably will not be returning here.

Upon arrival I was seated at the bar amd the welcome from the bartendwr was literally non existent. I immediately ordered my drink amd food selection to maximize the time. I ordered a lemon drop with sugar rim, which was eye appealing, but not the quality of a $23.00 lemon drop. I am not clear which alcohol was used in my drink, but the quality was definitely not price comparable. I was seated where the prepared food was placed and noticed two orders of French fries. I asked the bartender if she could check to see if they were mine. She looked at the tickets and stated I had a few orders ahead of mines. Needless to say- one of the two orders of fries was actually mines. My ceasar salad with salmon was filling, but I am not clear on the price difference from the menu versus what I was charged. I would not recommend this restaurant for dining and will not visit again.

Chicken dish looked like 1/8 of a chicken.

Wife had pasta with spicy vodka sauce. Pretty good. Did have a slight kick. Server was friendly and attentive. 2 beers, 1 glass of Sauvignon blanc, appetizer and 2 entrees wound up being $150. Personally didn’t think it was worth the money.

Paul,"Dined on August 31, 2023","The restaurant was a good experience and recommended. But I ordered the rigatoni and when asked if I would like some protein with it I said yes. In my mind that meant an add-on that might cost $5 or $6 to add in some chicken or salmon. I ordered salmon and was shocked to see the price of the add-on was $23 which was essentially the price of the main course rigatoni. I paid it and did not complain but I highly recommend in the future in the future they alert the customer or put it on the menu

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 5, 2023","The service was terrible. It wasn’t the waiter’s fault; they were very understaffed. We waited 15 minutes for a server, and that is only because I asked if we had one. We waited over an hour for our food. We asked for a small modification on a pasta dish, and we were told NO. I find it hard to believe there were no modifications because that would mean the pasta was just sitting in a vat, sauced and ready to go, and that’s for a $25 pasta dish. I don’t believe it. The bathrooms were really dirty, one was out of order, and one was basically flooded but still being used. Overall, it was a disappointment. I have messaged the restaurant & received no response. I have stayed at the Wit and dined in this place several times; this time, I was really disappointed.

We had reservations, which we needed because it was very crowded and several parties were turned away. Unfortunately, the kitchen was severely understaffed and it took nearly an hour to get our food. At least 3 parties left before getting their food order but since we were so close to the theatre, we decided to wait it out. The food did not disappoint, which was a relief. The deviled egg appetizer hit the spot. My husband’s burger was very tasty and I loved the salmon with colorful cauliflower and marble potatoes. Our waiter was very apologetic and did his best in a bad situation. We enjoyed the meal but would not go back unless we have a lot of time to kill.

Food was a little on the pricey side for what you got, but everything was absolutely delicious - including drinks.  The bar crowd caused it to be noisier than we expected a restaurant to be, and it'd have been nice if they turned the tvs off at some point.

Our drinks were never refilled and we weren’t asked if we wanted a refill.  When we asked for more water, we weren’t given any.  Then after paying we were sitting at the table talking and the hostess comes up to us and basically tells us we need to leave even though there isn’t a time limit on the table. We had only been there an hour.  It was a disappointing end to our dining experience.

Foodie,"Dined on April 14, 2023","I have been to this restaurant before for brunch and was excited to try it last night for dinner before a concert at the Chicago Theater.  The good things about this restaurant are that the food, drinks, and decor are fantastic.  The meatballs, salmon, and Wit Spritz were top notch.  However, we arrived early for our 630 reservation, and they were able to seat us early, around 6:05.  Our server did not ask if we had questions and was not very personable.  Our appetizer and drinks arrived really fast after ordering.  However, our entrees never arrived, and at 7:00, my friend flagged down the waiter to see what the issue was and to tell him we had concert tickets.  He checked with the kitchen and told us they had made a mistake.  Our food arrived piping hot 10 min later.  As mentioned, the food was great.  Our server offered to comp us another round of drinks or dessert to make up for the error.  Obviously, we could not do this as we needed to get to the theater for our show.  What irritates me is that he did not comp the drinks we had already ordered.  We should have just asked for a manager, obviously.  Our bill was $150 dollars for a 15 percent tip, 2 entrees, 3 drinks, and 1 app.  Pretty expensive considering we had to wait 45 min for our entrees.  Disappointing.

OK, we coughed it up though couldn't take full advantage (didn't want to fall asleep in theater). As we sat, two more parties came in, and both ordered off the menu! I mentioned this to the door staff as we left -- she said her boss had told her what to say, though no explanation for why the people who followed us didn't get the same treatment. (Needless to say, we didn't tip.) --I still recommend the place, as the food is good and generally it's reasonably priced, but I'd advise caution around holidays.

Honestly, the only major drawback from the experience was that the chairs were some of the most uncomfortable chairs I have sat in anywhere. We probably would've had another round or two of drinks and gotten dessert, but the chairs are really that bad. 
Definitely a worthwhile place to have a meal, but make sure you're in a booth, so you can enjoy it comfortably.

Thespian,"Dined on May 14, 2022","This is mostly about the service.
Server was nice at first. Then she kept disappearing. We were going to theater, told her that, yet every interval was too long, between saying we needed a minute  we asked other people & they couldn't find her either. When we finally spotted her passing our table to serve another table, and asked for the check, she snapped, ""Give me a minute, I'm here alone."" She wasn't. There were at least 2 other servers, and an assistant/busser who actually delivered the food (and was very nice and prompt.) Then once we had our credit card ready on the table, she walked by without looking HOLDING ANOTHER CREDIT CARD FOLIO and ignoring us, so we had to stand up and start leaving to get it done. It was ridiculous and we were almost late for curtain.

Food came out very promptly. Nicely presented. Brussels sprouts were amazing, as others have raved. Crab cakes (to me) were too mushy but the others liked them; the sauces were good. Deviled eggs were sort of tasty, not as good as homemade, very very small (like they used small eggs), not much on them, and came in a set of 5; we specifically asked how many cuz there were 3 of us and she said there were 6, so we ended up having to split one. Ridiculous. 
Cocktails and wine were massively overpriced; $16-$19. We had 3 appetizers (2 crabcake orders & 1 eggs order), 1 side (sprouts) & 2 cocktails and it was over $100 for 3 people. Luckily we saved on the tip because of her attitude and lack of attention. Might get the sprouts again as a takeout but wouldn't go back otherwise. Shame cuz we were excited to try a new place so close to the Oriental Theater. Live & learn.

ChgoLvr2,"Dined on May 1, 2022","I guess we should have been happy the employees who showed up to work were there, but it seemed like they didn't know what they were doing.  Thankfully the restaurant was not full because we waited over an hour from the time we sat down to when our food arrived.  Our waiter took our food order shortly after we arrived, so that was not the problem, although he did seem to disappear when we needed a beverage refill and our check.  There were tables all around us who arrived much after we did and they got their food before we did.  The employees delivering the food didn't seem to know which tables were which.  We watched two of our meals walk around the restaurant to two different tables before they made it to us.  It wasn't like we had a large table.  There were four of us and no complicated orders - a turkey sandwich, a burger, avocado toast and chilaquilles.  Three of us were about half finished with our meals when the turkey sandwich finally arrived.  I would hesitate to go back, which is unfortunate because I know how Chicago restaurants are struggling.  I will say the food was good, the poached eggs served with the chilaquilles were perfectly prepared.

We always go early to allow plenty of time to relax with a nice dinner before the show. Right now they offered a theater week menu which was way too much food, so I passed on that and had items off the regular menu. I will tell you...get the Brussel sprouts! I am not necessarily a big fan, but these were to die for. The order was plenty enough for the whole table to share, so one is fine. We all loved them. I could have just eaten that.

We had to ask for so many things multiple times, it actually almost became a joke. We understand that places are understaffed right now, but that doesn’t excuse bad manners. When we would ask for something again, the waitress would just say “we are busy”. We called the manager over and he had the same attitude. We tried to explain the situation and he just snapped, “So what do you want?” I mean, it was so bad we trauma bonded with the two tables next to us. I was really shocked that this place could have 1300 reviews and a 4.5 star rating. I will NEVER go there again. And I’m embarrassed that I’m the one who made the reservation there.

Both were well prepared, nicely presented, and very tasty. Unfortunately, the tavern is clearly suffering from a lack of employees. Our waitress must have been very new, as she seemed quite tentative, couldn’t answer a question about a dish, and was struggling with the basics of being a waitperson. (We still tipped her well, as she was trying. Ideally, she should have been paired with an experienced staff member.) The hostess never stopped, as she was taking up the slack for everyone else and managed to pull it all together so that service was not as bad as it might have been. They are lucky to have her!

StacyM,"Dined on November 5, 2021","We came for a late breakfast on a Friday, there were only 3-4 other tables with patrons, all but one of them already had their food. The place is beautiful, but has a tavern ambience, so it was a bit dark for a breakfast or lunch--however we knew that going into it, so mentioning it for others who wouldn't like it. 

The food was cooked very well although my breakfast potatoes were a bit undercooked, enough that I noticed it. The bacon and eggs were perfect though! 

The reason I would hesitate to return is lack of service. We sat for about 10 minutes, maybe more, and had to ask for someone to come take our orders. We received our food by someone else, then we noticed there wasn't any salt or pepper on any of the tables, even though there were jars of jelly and sweeteners. We couldn't get anyone's attention, so I went to the bar and asked for S&P. A bit later the server came back to refill our water, but didn't ask about my iced tea. When I was ready for more, again, I could not get anyone's attention, so I got the bartender's attention and asked for a refill. This is three times we had to flag someone down just for basic, normal aspects of dining at a restaurant. 

Service will make or break a place, and at times like these when patrons such as us are extending patience and understanding to understaffed businesses, it's just as important for staff to show patrons they are glad their establishment was chosen. We counted more staff than patrons too--we were #7 and #8, and there were more than 8 on staff, and the manager passed by our table many times and never looked our way.

I abhor doggy bags of any sort. For a table  of 3 we ordered 2 starters, the meatballs with polenta and the burrata on cruet. Both delicious!!! Two of us ordered the steak  fries. Super good... pro tip order rare and cut a bite of steak fork that with fries then dip then eat all together!!! I ordered the short ribs.... what a delightful flavor combination and the chef delivered it himself!!!!

It was explained to me by the hotel staff where State and Lake Chicago Tavern is located, that the restaurant was re-opening soon. They stated it was Open Table's fault for taking reservations. So be careful patrons, make sure the restaurant is actually opened before making a reservation on Open Table. Apparently Open Table can take reservations at closed restaurants!

SarahR,"Dined on September 19, 2021","We made our reservation through open table and the restaurant couldn’t find it and made us wait. I could tell someone was checked in under my reservation bc open table said “currently dining” but the waitress wouldn’t even check or apologize or anything. Then when we were sat outside by ourselves I waited 10 mins and had to go inside and ask for a waiter. We would have been fine waiting forever for food if we could just get some water…I had to send in another person from our party another 10 mins later just for water. I know places are short staffed but at least communicate and give us water.

Had the roast Amish chicken and the presentation was ridiculous. “Mustard greens” was a Dijon mustard sauce on the bottom, a haphazard cut green pepper sautéed and mixed with mixed greens. Chicken was fair, but the rest of the plate was inedible. Service was quite slow, though finally picked up toward the end. This place is certainly resting on happy hour and a captive audience in the attached hotel.

When we entered, another couple was waiting for the host to greet them and that was more than 5 minutes.  We were seated right away when the host finally arrived.  It took a very long time for the server to arrive.  He stopped by our table and acknowledged us and said he'd be back in 2 minutes.  When he finally arrived we ordered drinks and food at once.  Drinks and food (burger and mussels) were good.  My husband was able to order a second drink but the server never came back to check on us again and later I did want to order another.  I thought we could order desert but the server gave us the check not giving dessert as an option.  He said sorry if you wanted another drink and if I took too long.  The service was not very attentive.

She had to apply so much pressure, her elbow were skyward.  The meat was very leathery and tough.  I asked for a small bite myself to see if it was as bad as it seemed.  Horrible.  The manager was very swift at resolving, once we got her attention.  She tried to suggest an alternative but at this point we would've been late to our show.  The waitress seemed nice when we got there but she was not good.  She didn't seem very informed on the food and menu and was not only slow,  didn't come back to check on anything.   We had to flag someone else down to get her attention.  Very disappointing and not in line with the price point of the restaurant.    This was to be a special evening as we had been looking so forward to our show at the Chicago Theatre.

My dining companion's was cold, and I was served regular coffee instead of decaf.  Perhaps the cups were inadvertently switched on the way to the table?

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 14, 2019","This was our second visit to State & Lake for a dinner before a show.  They’re in tune enough to ask if you’re seeing a show, presumably to keep you on task if you can’t keep yourself on task.  Our reservation was for 5:15 and our show was 7:30, that gave us plenty of time to lazily make our way through 2 cocktails and to appetizers prior to ordering our entrees.  Recommend the Burrata & House made Guanciale as a cold starter, the Aged Cheddar Soft Pretzel as a hot start, the 72 Hr Local Short Rib “Steak” & the Pork Tenderloin Schnitzel as mains.  Would recommend reservations - we arrived about 20 mins early for ours, figuring we’d just sit at the bar before the reservation time & the place was empty but for about 6 ppl at the bar, but the hostess brought us right to the table.  Well by 5:30-6, there wasn’t an empty table.

JonathanS,"Dined on March 22, 2019","The food while not necessarily poor was sadly, underwhelming. However the portion size for the price was totally unacceptable. 25 dollars for bucatini in a simple red sauce? The burrata on top seemed at best an affectation. Desert while moderately priced was something we could have bought at Walgreens.


While no specific complaints about the service - our server seemed uncomfortable in the space and would have been more at home in a Greek diner.

Overall impression: an overpriced tourist trap that thinks it’s far more upscale than it actually is....

Avoid like the plague.

The waitress was pleasant when she finally arrived.  Apparently there was a run on pretzels because they were out of that appetizer item.  I ordered a cosmo and it was pretty bad.  There was vodka and tequila in it, which I have never heard of.  I even Googled it and couldn’t find a cosmo recipe with vodka and tequila.  My husband had a beer and said it was under carbonated.  Since they were out of the pretzel, we just ordered dinner.  The burger was fine, although it had a surprising smokey flavor.  Overall just meh.

Tables were a bit small, hard to get shared appetizers in the table and still have room for drinks.   Ordered mixed drinks that were very good, wish they were a few dollars cheaper and you would have had me for a third round.  Food was good, portions were average.  Overall I left satisfied, but for the higher prices I was hoping for either a bigger portion, way more flavor or a winning atmosphere.  The bar noise on a Thursday was a bit much by 9pm and it was tough to get to the restrooms as the bar crowd was shoulder to shoulder across the only aisle-way.  Service was good, time from order to food on the table was very prompt.  I was hoping for some specials or seasonal items but there weren't any.  I wasn't overly impressed with the menu.  It focused for on appetizers then main course.  Overall this is a great place for a really good mixed drink at the bar and some tasty apps...but I don't think I'll be back for a full meal.

It came with 2 sauces. The creamy apple mustard was almost buttery and the grainy mustard added just enough to add a bit of spice. My sister and both got the short rib. The meat was so tender. The polenta was so creamy and so different than traditional mashed potatoes. I’d say I would come here again.

I had the butter lettuce fennel salad that was good a little over dressed but a generous portion. I then had the meatballs that were very good with a nice tapenade and bread. It was very tasty and again a good portion along with the salad. My friend had the burger and she said it was very good and a good presentation. Our server was great and never rushed us. We did not have cocktails but they did look very interesting. I would definitely return

The waiter seemed annoyed that we needed more time to look at their very little limited menu. He was also annoyed that we didn't all order booze. The prices were okay for dinners but for appetizers they were way inflated. And there just was not much variety for food. Appetizers they had 6 on the menu then dinner plates 6 dinner choices. I just don't recommend this for anybody who's just trying to sit and chill and enjoy a meal that's relatively priced well. Perhaps it was price the way it is because it's attached to a hotel

BethB,"Dined on June 29, 2018","We stayed at TheWit the night we saw Kathy Griffin at The Chicago Theatre.  I made reservations at the restaurant at 6 and arrived a little early.  It was not busy yet, so glad we went early.  By the time we left at 7, it looked pretty full and was getting louder.
Husband and I both had the burgers.  The burger itself had a good flavor, but was a little overcooked (we ordered Med Rare).  The bottom of the bun was totally worthless and might as well have not been there.  We both had fries, which were good a hot.
For dessert I had the hot chocolate with mint - it had a strange flavor - not the mint I had been expecting.  Husband had a key lime pie frozen dessert, which apparently was something they purchased and came wrapped in clear cellophane.  Looked cheesy (and took them forever to find, apparently...), but he said it was very good.

I also had a Cucumber Moscow Mule which was a refreshing drink on  a very warm evening. The place is perfect for people watching and being with friends.

JennaF,"Dined on May 13, 2018","We stayed at the Wit, therefore we visited this establishment for both dinner and breakfast for convenience after a show with two kids.  The kids meals were amazing for both dinner and breakfast! No complaints there.  Adult breakfast meals were just meh.  Adult dinner meals were not good.  I have never sent a meal back, if I was that kind of person, I would've sent back my risotto.  It was AWFUL! Completely watery, flavors were bad.  We shared the pea pierogi and that was also not good.  The flavors did not work together.  I'm a polish girl from Pennsylvania, so I was excited for a pierogi.  Needless to say, we were extremely disappointed.  My husband got the roasted chicken.  The chicken was good but again, the sides were not up to par.  We ended up eating my daughter's mac and cheese. It's also worth noting that the man next to us sent back his pancakes at breakfast.  You would think pancakes would be a safe bet, right?  The ambiance was nice, though, but wait staff in the morning was much more pleasant than at night.  Since we were staying at the Wit, it gets 5 stars for convenience, at least.

Wait times for drinks was long and it took over 30 min after we ordered to our 3 entrees (a burger ordered medium, short rib entree, and my fiancé got the fried Brussels sprouts app for her dinner). They were busy but it wasn’t slammed in there so those dishes shouldn’t take longer than 15-20 minutes to come out even during peak dinner service. I had also mentioned in my reservation that we would be in a bit of a hurry since we were going to the show and also that it was my friends birthday but the server didn’t mention either of those things which makes me think she wasn’t told, which would be on management if that’s the case. I wasn’t expecting s free dessert or anything special like that but a simple acknowledgement (hey happy birthday) would have been nice. All in all I’d say it was a pretty average experience, the food was prepared well and tasted great but not much about the overall experience to draw me back anyone soon

We came for our anniversary here but they seat you super close to others in a tight space and it’s far too loud to hold a conversation. Don’t get me wrong, it was enjoyable, just not the type of atmosphere I was expecting.

I highly recommend the potatoes -- everything my girlfriend and I had was delicious. Service was attentive but not hovering, and the entire environment was moody and dark; perfect for date night. It has a beautiful ambiance and is a more low-key environment than The Roof.

PattyD,"Dined on January 8, 2018","I had been to State and Lake Chicago Tavern a few years ago and recalled a good experience. I suggested it for our dinner after a show with some friends recently. I was very disappointed in my meal choice, as was one of my friends. 3 guests were pleased with their meals. I ordered a ""salmon salad"" and it was the weirdest thing I have ever eaten. And not in a good way. Strange combination of ingredients that did not go well together. One friend ordered a ""beet salad"" and it was mostly cabbage and hardly any beets. She did not like it. We did have roasted brussel sprouts appetizer that was very good, as well as a big pretzel with mustard (also good). Bottom line--order the burger. It looked delicious.

The butternut squash pasta looked unappetizing & there wasn't any squash in it.  It wad just ok.  Our server had the personality of a wet noodle.  She was not excited to be there. We wanted a cozy table for the 2 of us & ended up at a tiny table with no legroom next to the hostess table.  The whole dinner we overheard the hostesses gabbing & gossiping.  With so many great places to eat downtown,  I'd rank this pretty low.  Only plus us a great location.

Scribbler,"Dined on December 9, 2017","We went to State and Lake Chicago Tavern prior to seeing ""Wicked"" during the holidays.  It's a nice alternative to the usual very busy, very loud pre-theater restaurants in the area.  By contrast, this is small enough that it was quiet and conversation-friendly.  Food was good, many options for   different tastes, and the service was fine; the food came plenty quickly and we even had time for dessert.  The only small thing that was off was that the bar didn't appear to have much in the way of traditional alcohol, while it was heavy on the beer.  They didn't have Hendricks Gin, for example, which isn't exactly exotic.  They didn't have Belvedere or Chopin vodka, either.  So those little things seemed odd but they didn't spoil the experience.  We'll remember it next time we catch a show in the Theater District.

None of us are picky eaters so it’s remarkable that all 3 of us found the meal not palatable, seriously terrible, no taste, like cream of wheat. We ordered 2 orders of fries and ate those before our theater time. Service was okay but that’s the first time I couldn’t eat a meal served to me, and likewise for the 2 others in our party.

I wanted something simple that evening and just ordered a Tavern Burger. After a short time it was delivered piping hot and delicious. 
My coffee was refilled and I enjoyed my dinner. 
The restaurant was about 3/4 full this early Sunday evening and the vibe was casual, friendly and easy. Whether staying at the hotel or visiting the nearby theater it’s an easy and enjoyable choice.

KMG58,"Dined on October 28, 2017","We ate at State and Lake last Friday night while visiting our son in Chicago.  I would not recommend the place on a weekend night as the Loop really empties out and the feel was really transient tourists rather than a loyal local following.  The food was good (the burger and the pasta, and the pretzels and trout spread for starters, and the Old Fashioned are terrific) but a little high-priced for what you got.  I think the most disappointing aspects are 1) Ambience: the feel is dark, a little loud, and very impersonal - kind of like eating in a railroad station pub.  2) Service: no real welcome from the hostess, and then our waitress sloshed a bunch of beer when she put one of our glasses on the table and didn't even apologize let alone return to clean it up, so we got a napkin from another table to do just that.  She may have been terribly overworked or distracted but she was not a good fit for the hospitality business for sure.  It made me resolve to be super-appreciative of all the fine servers out there in the world.  Bottom line, we won't return.

Our server was really nice, but he appeared to be handling a lot of tables by himself and the service was a little slow. We also noticed that another server was neglecting her tables and those customers were getting impatient. Management could do a better job of improving service and making sure they're properly staffed during busier times. It's close to the Chicago Theater, so it's convenient for a pre-show bite or drink. If you're heading to a show, I would recommend letting them know so they don't forget to check in on you.

My sister's pasta was cold, my Dad's burger was terribly overcooked and they seemed to be very short staffed to the point where it took 15+ minutes to get a drink.  Multiple tables were visibly upset and complaining to the manager & for her credit she took it all in stride with true grace under pressure.

The salad I ordered was supposed to have oil and vinegar on the side.  It had been dressed already and had vinegar soaked grape slices that made me choke.  Sent it back.  My friend ordered the beet salad which had a beet giardinara that was also had too much vinegar.  The toast that came with it was cold and soft.  The brought different toast and it was the same.  Waitress said they make it all ahead of time.  My salad and burger with no bun arrived together and my friend waited almost ten mins for their salad.  We had to chase down the waitress with each problem.  I won’t recommend State and Lake again!  My burger and fries were fine.  I have been here numerous times.  This was not good!

The lemon pomegranate sorbet had a unique favor but as I asked for it to go was little more than a frozen icee. Hopefully different when eaten in the restaurant. 

It was late and while I was asked if I'd like anything else it was apparent it was the end of the night service wise as the consistency of who was taking care of me was based mostly on who was nearby and  ""excuse me's"".

Our waiter was outstanding and very polite. He gave us great service and was timely. My first glass of wine seemed pretty small amount although they have large wine glasses. When my second glass of wine arrived it was considerably more in the glass.  I wondered if I had earlier was the last of a bottle?  We ordered the appetizer Garlic Mussels. It was improperly cooked and we had to send it back.  When we received the better cooked mussels we had to have our dinner come out right away since we had a show to attend at the Chicago Theater across the street. My husband ordered the steak which is pricey. But it didn't taste like it. It seemed a bit dry and over cooked. We don't mind spending money on dinner but I do expect the food to equal the price. I would have had a better tasting steak at the Outback and pay less. Again our waiter was excellent. He made the evening seem less troublesome. Next time I go to the Chicago Theater, I would consider eating somewhere else.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 3, 2017","We were there for a pre-theater dinner.  We were waited on right away with drinks and an appetizer but once we ordered our food it took about 1/2 hour to bring it.  The place was virtually emptied out by the time we got our food.  It worked out ok since the show started late - but I think our dishes had been sitting in the kitchen for a bit.  I had the chicken and it was good but cold.

Lulu,"Dined on April 2, 2017","I've eaten mussels in many restaurants over many years, but I've never had a mussel dish this bad - ever.  The mussels were tiny, dry, often shells with nothing inside, the so-called sauce was a few tablespoons of unflavored liquid, the bagget was two stale pieces of cold bread.  I would have sent it back but since we rarely saw our waiter and had a show to go to, I mostly just left it, and left hungry after spending a lot of money on a couple glasses of wine.   That said, the broccoli salad was good and my companion enjoyed her burger.   I would not return, however.

Most restaurants can accommodate for the allergy and provide a much broader selection.  Because of this I would not be able to return.

ditzydiner,"Dined on March 19, 2017","The State Lake Restaurant is in the trendy Wit Hotel at one of the Chicago Loop's busiest corners.  You can enter the restaurant through the hotel lobby (which overlooks the State Lake ""L"" platform) or through the restaurant's own State Street entrance.  The menu is limited, but has everything for a burger to entrees, plus a variety of bar plates (they get an after work bar crowd.)  Entrees were much better than I anticipated and fairly priced.  Cocktails were expensive (downtown hotel rates) but well-made and generous.  Good beer options.  Atmosphere is casual but comfortable.  We were there during March Madness and there were too many TV screens for my taste -- but I've been there at other times and learned that the TVs retractable (they actually retract into the walls when there are no major events).

Whats4SupperChicago,"Dined on March 12, 2017","Overall, my group did not have a largely positive experience. I made the reservation same-day for my group of 8, on St. Patrick's Day, which was VERY convenient. Considering there were lines of people waiting to get into many restaurants/ bars in downtown Chicago, we considered ourselves lucky to get a reservation for our group. 

We arrived a few minutes early and the restaurant had several available tables, but we still had a 10 minute wait until we were seated (after 5 minutes of waiting, they cleared off and cleaned a large table for 8 people that had been unused at the time of our arrival). Our server seemed like he was having a stressful day (which is understandable, considering we were downtown in Chicago on St. Patrick's Day), but was not very attentive to our table and always seemed to be in a hurry with us, even though there were a lot of open tables and the restaurant didn't seem slammed. 

Multiple times throughout the meal, the Handicap door entrance to the restaurant (which was right next to our table) was opened, which forced the cold air from outside into our faces at the table (it was around 30 degrees outside at the time of our meal). One time, it was opened by two members of the restaurant staff who needed to dump a large trough of ice outside... VERY cold...

All in all, I think that our experience was not great, but that under different circumstances and with a few tweaks, it could have been a lot better.

Prices are high and don't include very much.  There were three of us --- the salmon portion was very small, the porkchop was large --- but completely untrimmed with nothing else on the plate. We asked for bread --- and what came was pretty tired and meager. Dessert was great, but the food level just not high enough to justify the prices.  The friend with the burger was happy --- if I come back, I'll probably stick to the burger and a beer.

Were seated at a table still being cleared (though there were other empty tables available). Waiter immediately poured coffee, had to be beckoned back to the table so we could request cream. I ordered hot tea and had to order again from another waiter who came along later after never receiving it from the first. All the while, no spoons at the table so my colleagues were using their knives and forks to stir their coffee. Placed our order. Asked for spoons. Spoons delivered. Order delivered except for the toast. Halfway through our meals, still no toast. Beckoned the waiter who said he'd check on the toast right away. Brought the toast. Explained the delay due to bread being downstairs in freezer. What?! We had to ask for butter. He brought the butter, explaining that the butter isn't gluten free so they don't put it on gluten free toast. What?! I questioned that and he said that's what the chef says. That waiter disappeared. We literally didn't see him again. Host came to fill our water glasses and explains that they don't butter the gluten free toast because frequently guests who order gluten free also are dairy free. Fine. Or, I suggested, your could ask the guests when they order. She said that's why the waiter brings butter separately. Yes, I said, after you ask for it. Again, great food. Horrible service.

Breakfast was outstanding. The weekend brunch menu had several dishes that tempted me. I had the burnt ends hash with perfect poached eggs on top. Great English muffin on the side and wonderful coffee. I'll definitely stop here for breakfast again even if I'm not staying at the hotel.

I don't eat meat or poultry, and there was almost nothing for me. Even the one fish dish was cooked in duck fat and served with cabbage cooked with pork! I ordered the only vegetarian dish, a risotto with rapini. The rapini was burnt, tough, stringy, and so bitter as to be inedible. The risotto was lukewarm. I sent it back, and eventually received a replacement that was much better. The waiter and manager were apologetic and the manager took 20% off our check. But we will not go back. In the past there was a large selection of fish and vegetarian options. This new menu, introduced by the new chef, is meat-heavy, and not at all appealing to me. Very disappointing.

When the food arrived--my meal was completely missed. They didn't even realize that it was missing. We had to flag down a server who happened to be a manager. She went to talk to our server and 5 minutes later I had a very rare burger in front of me. I cut in to it and realized I wouldn't eat it. We had to flag down another server and they brought the manager back. They took my burger--with ketchup and mustard already on it-and just put both halves back on the grill. I would have expected them to do it right and get a new burger. I didn't eat it. They did comp my meal but the gratuity was already added to our check.

Jessica,"Dined on March 20, 2016","We really enjoyed our dinner here. We were going to a show at the Chicago Theater so it was very convenient. I would recommend reservations as the place filled up fast shortly after we arrived. For starters, we had the charcuterie and cheese boards which were both excellent. While some other places have been chintzie with the amount they give you, both boards were surprisingly generous. I had one of their Manhattans (North and West?) which was good although a bit pricey. For dinner, I had the pork chop and my husband had the bison meatloaf. The pork chop was really juicy and tasty although it was a bit difficult to cut into while it was atop beans (also tasty) in a skillet. I ended up launching some beans onto the saucer for the skillet. My husband really enjoyed his meatloaf and was very pleased with his choice. We did not have time to stay for dessert, but we would definitely be back should we need dining in that area again. Our server was also very attentive without being overbearing and had great suggestions (to which some we did partake).

We were seated quickly, next to the floor to ceiling windows facing State Street, with nice views all around.  Even though we were between two other parties, it didn't feel crowded and it was easy to have a private conversation.  My wife asked for some extras beyond the menu descriptions (change to a cocktail ingredient, additional dipping item for the delicious pimento cheese spread), and she was accommodated without hesitation.  Our main courses, steak and one of their signature burgers, were perfectly done.  And our side potatoes, mashed and hand cut fries, also were very tasty.  
The only slight drawback was that our waiter was not as attentive as he could have been after the meal was served, but one of his fellow waiters jumped in to check on us.  We certainly will consider this again among our options before or after a show downtown.

We waited over a half hour to get our food order, which I think is unacceptable. We became very conscious of the time as we ate. Not very relaxing to say the least.
The food, while a bit pricey, was very good. The ambiance was noisy and a bit frenetic with sports on the ever present tv's and country music playing at a night club level.
Our server did not remove a couple of items from our bill that we had not ordered...making our exit take even longer.
We ordered a dessert in advance because of our time issue and that also mysteriously took much longer than necessary. 
Overall... a nice place to hang with adults before a concert, not a family friendly place when time crunched.

We had such a leisurely, relaxing time! We ordered a simple breakfast of fruit & bagels, but nothing was ordinary about them. The fruit was a lovely assortment of berries, melon & even my favorite watermelon! The bagels were toasted to perfection & loved the assortment of jam. What really made our experience special was our waiter George. He was very cheery, offered recommendations & very prompt with service. He could tell we were enjoying our leisurely time & checked on us to make sure we had enough coffee & water. The additional waitstaff were very pleasant as well.

That being said, this outpost of the Wit hotel isn't bad.  Food and drinks are typically over priced but both are quite good.  Service is friendly but pretty hands off and a bit, um, immature.  On weekends, there is low key live music in the bar/dining area.  The mussels were quite good, the charcuterie board was so-so.  The mushroom barely soup with meatballs was unusual and tasty but the portion was skimpy. All in all, it's not a bad place to catch a bite  and/or a drink (cocktails and beer are better options than wine) before or after a Chicago Theatre show because location location location!

We ordered the Fish tacos, which were extremely bland and had nothing on them but slaw and that was the only thing on the plate...two lousy tacos for $14. We had drinks which were extremely pricey and not enough booze in them.

The hotel's restaurant, State & Lake is amazing. It is casual, and has a limited menu which has a choice for everyone!  Appetizers, soups, salads, burgers and full dinners in a wonderful atmosphere.

Corey was our server and he was incredible. He provided suggestions, answered questions we had, and had a wonderful sense of humor. Excellent customer service.

We had the delicious deviled eggs (State & Lake style) appetizer which were fabulous. The bone-in pork chop dinner was tender and had a great taste.

We will return here soon. It was so convenient if you're attending the Chicago Theater. Thank you for a great meal.

It was so close I thought I might need to stand up to let the patrons and the server in and out. The food and drinks were very good, but the service was a bit slow and it was difficult for us to locate our server. We ordered a variety of appetizers instead of dinners. Empty plates stayed on our table until very end of the meal. We would've ordered another round of drinks, but we couldn't find our server and we were attending a play so we were on a schedule. I would give it another try because the food is good.

I would have granted 5 stars if not for the very substandard service from our waitress.  This was not a waitress that was swamped.  She was frequently just aimlessly standing around.  It was challenging to get drinks, to get our check, and to get our payment taken.  There was one waiter that I wish had been ours; he kept walking over to our waitress and telling her to assist us.

Donna,"Dined on June 10, 2015","We went for cocktails and dinner before a show at Chicago Theater. Our reservation (for 6) was at 6:15. Three of us arrived at 6:00 and we were seated right away at an 8-top. After sitting awhile, we asked the hostess to find our server. Eventually, someone (who claimed he was not our server) took our drink order. Meanwhile the rest of our party showed up; our drinks came after another 10-minute wait. We ordered our food ASAP and actually made some revisions because our server warned us that some of the items took longer. The meal didn't come for over a half-hour, even though we DIDN'T order the items that he warned would take up to 20-minutes! The burger was good, fish tacos were terrible, roasted cauliflower was not cooked enough (too hard to chew) but we had no time to waste so we didn't send anything back (except the extra fish tacos that we didn't even order?). After flagging down any server for our bill, we were surprised to see that they had charged us for the extra fish tacos that we never ordered, AND they had tacked on 20% gratuity!. Given the fact that we received terrible service and the food was not good, I resent the automatic 20% gratuity. I'm normally a very big tipper but this meal was ridiculous - I will not return.

Turned out it was motocross and they coudn't figure out how to change the audio.  Then it was so loud that you couldn't hear yourself talk, let alone anyone else.

It arrived promptly and was tasty, especially the accompanied ramp jam/goat cheese spread.  We ordered our entrees - a burger & fries, a salad, and a soup, about 6pm.  We weren't served until 7pm and had to gobble down our food to make the show.  We were looking forward to after dinner drinks and dessert but obviously didn't have enough time.  The food was fine but nothing special, and WAY overpriced.  Our meal, with tax & tip was $100 ... for 1 pretzel, 1 cocktail and 1 pepsi, a plain burger & fries, a salad (no protein) and a soup!  I don't  think it was our server's issue - I believe it's a problem with the kitchen since most tables sat without food for as long as we did.  We won't be returning.

We started with cocktails, which were spot on, and then moved on to the cheese and charcuterie plate, which was excellent. Our server was fantastic, striking just the right balance between friendly and professional. She did a great job of pacing our meal so that we weren't rushed but we also weren't waiting for our food. The only thing I didn't like was that my entree was waaaay over salted. I like salt, and I have nothing against it, but I had the pork chop with sauteed greens on the side, and both were so salty that I couldn't finish it. My guess is that someone in the kitchen just got carried away because I can't imagine that what I got is really what the restaurant is going for.

The cappuccino is a generous portion served with 2 ginger cookies sprinkled with sea salt. Yum!  The atmosphere is not very romantic, as there isn't privacy. They have large screen tvs good for watching sports, and they used some of them for showing a crackling fireplace.

Food was good with lots of interesting looking ingredients. The food was slid at me across my table, sometimes by a bus boy type who was assisting Mellissa. I never had a chance to ask and she had no interest in explaining. She did a couple walk bys to say how is it but did not remain in the vicinity to hear my answer. I specifically said that although I was dining alone I was in no hurry. Being the only one at the table sometimes leads to the food coming too quickly. This night, the third course was put on the table before I had finished the chili second course.

Fantastic,"Dined on December 27, 2014","Our experience at the State and Lake Chicago Tavern was overall not that great!  It was very disappointing that with a reservation made 3 days prior to our visit we were seated in a table near the door that was opened no less than 6 times during our dinner which, of course, caused a ton of cold air to rush onto our table.  

I expected that with the restaurant less than 1/2 full and having a reservation, to be seated in a more desirable area of the restaurant, we just didn't ""show up"" and expect to be seated.  The table was under a staircase as well and a huge stuffed decoration was above our table which was a little unnerving as well and left you feeling a bit uncomfortable.

The food was very good and our service was adequate but the door opening and closing was obnoxious at best.  Plus when you are eating warm food with a cold rush of air, your soup is going to cool off.  

I was not left with an overall great experience and probably won't go back.

Thanks

However the drink service is slow and was the last time I came. The food is quicker that the drinks. Not sure if you sit at the bar if that's quicker but when you have to wait more than 15 minutes for your first drink I think that is too slow.,4 stars,Overall 4,Food 5,Service 3,Ambience 4

chiattorney,"Dined on November 28, 2014","We had a party of 13 for an 11am table. We did not realize that breakfast ended at 11 where we had all intended to order brunch items. Totally our fault for not looking at the times clearly listed on the menu. Our waiter (who was awesome) spoke with the kitchen and allowed us to get our breakfast orders in before the chef started transitioning the kitchen to lunch. That was a lot of work for our large party and we really appreciated it! The service we received was top-notch. Our waiter was attentive and helpful. He made great menu suggestions too. The food was really great but the service was the standout on this visit. Would definitely go back and recommend it to friends.

DavidZ,"Dined on November 24, 2014","Stopped at this place after a show at Chicago Theater.  It was near, convenient and they sat us right away.  Service started a bit slow, even though it wasn't crowded.  It seemed they were understaffed and servers were running all over the restaurant.  Once we got someone's attention service was smooth as it should be.  

Ordered the bucket of chicken during brunch, which took a bit longer than advertised, and it wasn't a complete order.  Food was tasty and freshly prepared which made up for the rocky start. 

I would probably go back for drinks and appetizers, as the bar had thorough service coverage.  Definitely not for a big party, as I saw a big party not getting service for a while.

We were passed off to 3 different people before we got to our table, weaving around tables already full of people and placed very close to each other.  Although the staff was friendly enough, at this point I felt kind of like a bother to them.  Once we got to our table, the service was stellar from our waitress to the guys helping bring out the food and clear the table and such.  Our glasses were full and our table was clean at all times.  Although the appetizer made me nervous at first, it along with the rest of the food was very good.  As we were leaving, we had to hunt down someone to give us our coats from coat check.

Paired with the sports bar TVs, the manufactured noise is a statement of inconsideration.

We ordered the mussels and chicken thighs.  The mussels portion was overly generous...couldn't even finish them.  The chicken thighs were not a large portion but delicious!  We were still hungry so we split the deconstructed cobb salad, which was fresh and nicely portioned on individual plates at no extra charge.  I had the macaroon sandwich, which was very good but could have been half the size, and a small side of chocolate sauce would have made it even better.

The veggies were slightly over-salted for my taste, but still good. The service was a bit slow - we probably would have ordered another round of drinks or dessert, but the server didn't come back around after the first round. What we did get was very good. They had live music which was great. The only downside to that is there was some kind of piano bar thing going on upstairs that was drowning out the singer downstairs. Overall - wonderful experience.

It either tends to be too small, not enough corned beef, too many potatoes, eggs over done - something, there is always something. However, this is not the case at State and Lake. This was by far the best I ever had. It was filling - to the point where I could not finish. Chunky corned beef, that threatened to be too salty, but reminds me of good corned beef. The potatoes were excellent, and the eggs cooked to perfection. I went to breakfast at 9:30 on a Tuesday, so the place was quiet. That being said, seating could be an issue as the hostess's first attempt was at a banquette positioned tightly against the table a side me.

It was almost an hour before our food showed up.   The charcuterie plate was unimpressive.   One of our main entries came cold and had clearly been sitting around in the kitchen for a while.  Our other entry -- pork loin -- was OK but certainly not worth the wait.   This is one of my worst experiences in the past two years.

Living in Chicago and having eaten and many Chicago restaurants via this strikes me as an overpriced tourist trap. Blaring music, mismatched decor, overpriced food.

Service: friendly but confused, unacceptable wait times for drinks and food

Food: Passable but overpriced...smoked wings were good but they were served with maple popcorn on top...strange attempt at a garnish (slightly charred and soggy sitting in the wing sauce)...steak was too charred on outside, diced root vegetables served with it were paltry and dry...burger too big to eat comfortably and unremarkable.

Better choices for the money IMHO.

Food and Service are excellent !
Love the Location.....
My only negative is the wine List.
While they have a HUGE Beer selection, I am not a Beer Drinker, the wine choices are very Limited and Extremely Overpriced !
The most economical bottle of Red wine is $50 ! And this is for a wine that Retails for $10,,, Thats a 500% mark up !!!!
I understand that the clientele is geared toward the younger Beer drinking crowd, but it would be wise if they had a little more of a selection starting in the mid $20 Dollar range in order to be competitive with the other restaurants in the area.

Bdines,"Dined on February 28, 2014","I like a place that takes itself seriously and is determined to get better. That's what S&L Chicago Tavern does well. Everytime I go, management makes a point to ask what I think; and they listen. The chicken thighs are melt in your mouth goodness, the herbs & greens salad is ultra fresh; the huge burger with swiss and the most crazy addicting fries make the $14.00 plate seem like a drop in the bucket. An added plus was to be able to see the Blackhawks play (and unfortunately lose) while conversing with a friend. Server, Bonny was attentive,very helpful, friendly. Precisely what customers want when dining. We ordered dessert - the Elderberry Lemon Pie. Hands down, THE BEST lemon pie I've ever had. Theirs is homemade on the premises!

Management immediately came to apologize (offered to make us another one, which we declined), but needless to say oversight of this nature is alarming. Raw chicken is unacceptable and dangerous in any respectable restaurant. The grits and the short rib wild rice soup were good. Cocktails were decent. They do not seat you until the entire party is present and there is no room at the bar to grab a drink, so make sure you are dining with punctual people.

I thought the pickled okra served with the smelt were an interesting taste that I hadn't had before and look forward to having again. We then split the cheese curd burger with sweet potato fries. The fries were surprisingly different. They were panko breaded and not mushy, but rather firm to the bite, which was an interesting texture that we really enjoyed. I think they should think about using the panko breading for the smelt. Great food and great service!

We arrived at 7:30 p.m. and it was 30 minutes before we were able to flag down a wait person to get a cocktail. Then he disappeared and we had to flag down someone else, at which point a manager apologized and ""guaranteed"" us that he would turn around the experience. Sadly, he did not. We finally ordered the charcuterie tray - which was a joke! It consisted of a tiny piece of some type of fatty pate, a few slices of pickles (seriously - only 5 or 6), two tiny piles of what looked like prosciutto accompanied by some mustard and a few slices of mediocre bread. We had mussels, an order of fries and the whitefish - all were tasteless. With 3 drinks it cane to $134!

Not worth the effort. Not bad, just okay. I am an absolute pain in the petard about my food and wine, but the waiter was so delightful. He allowed me to taste a few of the reds, which I was pleasantly surprised by. The wine bottle prices are about what you'd expect for the area but I think the food prices are awfully reasonable, given the quality and the creativity of the kitchen.

They have a good drink menu and have a wide variety of menu items to choose from. When we were back in the city for a show, we were able to snag a reservation again before our show. Even though the restaurant was ""busy"" with multiple large parties, we still have quick and great service and good food! If I worked downtown, I would say this would be a great place to stop and get a drink with coworkers after work.

Be prepared to pay a bit, though: 6 people, we ordered 3 ""jars"", 3 appetizers, 5 mains and 2 desserts, plus 1 gin&tonic, 2 beers, 1 root beer float and 1 glass of wine. 70$ per person including tip. I say that's over-priced, because the appetizers were fun but small, the jars are just some patés (including kale, not exactly foie gras) and the mains were good, but not astounding. My salmon was a bit blend and slightly overcooked. But here is live music on Saturday after 10pmand the pumpkin ice-cream taco was deliciousl

Drinks were expensive for the pour you received, and the bartender kept putting lemons in our captain and cokes (usually it would be a lime). Overall, would consider stopping in for a drink and quick app in the future but too noisy to hang out and talk with people over several drinks and food.

Had the maple chicken and it was very good - could have had a bit more side served with it as that was amazing. I'll go back - a few things on the menu I still want to try. Go.

Ironchefwannabe,"Dined on September 26, 2013","This was our fifth visit over a roughly three-year period. The menu has changed with each visit, and this menu is for the current trend of tasting and sharing plates. But all the dishes we've eaten here have been consistently good, and the main reason why we return. Of particular note this time was the Brisket of Beef Bacon Hamburger, which I got with an extra topping of sauteed trumpet mushrooms. It was HUGE, but incredibly delicious and the fries were phenomenal. In general, the portions are almost too generous, but more than adequate for sharing (which we did not do). Our only complaint is that the music was better suited for a ZUMBA class than dining. So if food is your thing, it's a thumbs up; but for conversation, it's a thumbs down.

TuesdayNights,"Dined on August 25, 2013","To start, this restaurant has two doors (one off State, one through the Wit's lobby.) The hostess stand sits by the lobby door, and the staff seemed to be completely unprepared to deal with patrons who walked in from the street side. We arrived on time, for instance, but were seated at an unset table behind the stairs. Although I specifically stated we had a reservation, later had to tell OpenTable we were there. The food ranged from unremarkable (eggs were okay) to unappetizing (salad tasted like it was straight out of the bag) to inedible (bacon and fig jam was cold and hard.) Very disappointing for the price point, the location, and the hotel chain. We wished we had had gone to Sable or The Publican or even PQM instead. NOT recommended.

Once seated we were asked by the hostess if we wanted to eat from the Brunch or the bar menu as we only had 5 more minutes to decide before brunch was no longer an option When we asked to see what was on the bar menu, we were informed that we couldn't see it until after 2:00 and that we needed to decide just from what we saw on the brunch menu! It then took our waiter 15 minutes to approach our table for drink orders while he stood at the bar talking to the bartender. His service improved slightly after that but we were so irritated at the beginning that it pretty much ruined the experience. The food was excellent.

After reviewing the menu, we opted to not have a full meal, but to enjoy many of the small tapas type offerings, so that we could try many different items, and all were GREAT!

We enjoyed three jar offerings, the fig and pepper bacon jam, sweet and sour beet and the crushed chickpea, and all were delicious! We also tried the local cheese board, deviled eggs, and the beef cheek meatball, and it was hard to determine which we liked the best! We ended the meal wtih the neapolitan ice cream taco, and what a treat that was!

We started with 3 spreads for the table served with baguette slices. Then we shared housemade soft pretzels with a SPICY cheese dip and mustard. Then we each ordered soup, salad, and one friend had a burger. Add a glass of wine for each of us and the bill inc tip was about $45/person.

DougR,"Dined on April 6, 2013","We went there before seeing ""Archer Live"" at the Chicago Theater. We told the host that we were in hurry and orders were taken quickly which was great. We deliberately ordered cold things that should have been easy to prepare, like cheese plate. However it took almost 40 minutes just to get that. Our waiter did not check back often. When we complained, the host did buy a round of drinks, which was good customer service. He explained that there was always a built in 30-minute delay to get food at that time and that should have been told to us. That really seems strange. After the show we went to The Gage, which was at least as busy as State and Lake. Their service was prompt, so I'm not sure why this place can't do better service.

GaryCo,"Dined on April 5, 2013","I had dinner on the first night. It was OK but the braised beef soup was tasteless and
awfully watery. The steak entrée was very disappointing. Once again, poorly flavored and very badly presented on the plate. The next day I tried a small bite for lunch, the walleye crispers, which was mostly breading with very little fish. Awful. I have also eaten at the restaurant on the top floor which is pretentious and very noisy.

Here is the bad news. The hotel, The Wit, which houses these terrible restaurants once housed the classy Cibbo Matto, one of the best restaurants in Chicago.It was a 4-5 star restaurant which should have been maintained. Unfortunately, this so called hip hotel caters to the pedestrian tastes of 20 or somethings.

Our only critique is that the restaurant didn't provide a drink menu; we planned on ordering drinks for Christmas, but were unaware of any drink specials.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 18, 2012","I have been to this restaurant many times in the past, particularly pre-theater since the Chicago Theater is right next door. Usually the service is spotty but the food is good - burgers and sandwiches and very reasonable. This visit, however, although the service was good, the menu has changed and offers less variety. The addition of the spreads in jars is particularly awful - we tried the shrimp jar and it was not good. The decision to eliminate the salads and sandwiches that previously formed the bulk of the menu was unfortunate as the remaining items either seemed too heavy or too expensive. I would no longer recommend this restaurant, even despite its convenience to the theater.

I really appreciated that they could accommodate me without any advance notice, and the service was fast and friendly. At the waiter's recommendation, I had both the duck tacos and the steak & cake. The duck tacos were fabulous, and a worthwhile reason to return to the restaurant on any occasion; however, the steak was not generally up to Chicago standards. Don't get me wrong--the steak was fine, and it was tasty, but it was a little chewy, and few places have really mastered steak the way many places in downtown Chicago have, so anywhere else it would have been well above expectations. And, in all fairness, it was fairly inexpensive for what I got.

The relatively small dining room was busy with couples and friends getting together after work (I had booked, and was glad). The food and drinks were good, not fabulous, but the whole experience was elevated by the great service we got from Aja. She could describe every dish on the menu, make informed wine and cocktail suggestions, and was generally efficient and pleasant. We started with the meat and cheese board, which we thought was just average--meats were a bit fatty and the cheeses were ordinary (Brie, for example). We both had entree salads. Mine came with some well prepared spicy seared tuna, but the greens and dressing were uninteresting.

I understand that there are salt and pepper shakers at the table but that is what makes you different from other hamburgers at less reputable establishments. The shrimp cocktail that was bad, I am sorry, but that is horrible. It seemed that it was preplated and put in the cooler because the cocktail was set and the glass had all sorts of finger prints on it. I could tolerate the burger, the buffalo fries were mediocre, its one of those deceiving things where it sounds great on the menu but the execution is not there. My last comment, drum roll please... The server told us that the (your) restaurant ordered the largest shrimp possible for this cocktail.

He asked what our plans were for the night so that he could make sure to serve us properly. I chose a tasting special (three courses) with scallop and succotash, red snapper in a piquant ""Veracruz"" sauce with a kick, and some chocolate and bacon-covered chocolate for dessert.

They are just not trained well...I know you will not get 4 star wait staff at a casual bar type place, but keeping water glasses full and offering a second glass of wine should be high on the list....we'd have each had another drink if asked. If the service was better, it'd be 4-5 star review.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 10, 2012","The Hosts were helpful upon arrival. Service, however, was slow, before the restaurant was starting to get busy. The portions for our meals (when we eventually got them), were very small for the money. Although, the ladies at the table next to us looked to have the best salad I have ever seen. The room looked great and the beer/wine list was very nice. I'd be inclined to try again and hope the service was an anomaly, but it will probably not be any time soon.

Only problem was that the kitchen switches over from breakfast to lunch at noon, which is exactly when we sat down. Server informed us that he wouldn't be able to put in our order for at least 15 mins. Other than that, a very enjoyable experience, and I would go again.

They have excellent draft beer selection, I had Dogfish head 90min IPA. She ordered a drink, without even asking, a manager noticed she didnt like it, and came over, took it away with a smile and offered us a drink on the house. Quick service despite it being busy. Will definitely be coming here again, and I should also note I was not staying at this hotel but it is a beautiful one.

Some guys might be left feeling like they wanted more but it was perfect portions for us. I had the shrimp po boy with a side salad and my friend had the roasted chicken with mashed potatoes and broccolini.

On our particular visit, the service was a little off the mark. Despite 2 reminders, our dessert never came, even though we paid for it. Eventually, they packed it up to go, and the manager was really nice & offered a free dessert next time. We'll give it another try next time.

We were able to fix it, but my experience is a 15 or 18% inclusion is acceptable, not 20%. Our server was new and so, so. We were celebrating a special occasion.

Service, however, was just mediocre.  Our waitress was never around.  The bottles of water on the tables can be deceptive - they are not free, and the waitress didn't bother to tell us this before we reached for it. For the price that brunch/breakfast runs here, the service just didn't measure up.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 8, 2011","Service was awful. First round of drinks ordered took around 15 minutes to be delivered, all the while we watched the bartender on duty just stand there and do nothing. Numerous items on the menu were not available. Items requested from server were never brought to the table. Glass of champagne was ordered and only two options provided were Proseco and $25 glass of champage. Price of glass of champagne was never disclosed and the same glass of champagne at a restaurant on Michigan Ave, 3 blocks away was only $9. Very disappointing experience and will never return. Will not refer this restaurant to any clients or fiends, will refer them to other restaurants in the area.

chicagosully,"Dined on April 22, 2011","The Wit Hotel is a very hip place in a hip part of the Loop. State and Lake is a perfect restaurant whether you want to have a casual lunch or a great dinner that won't break your wallet. I have been about three times now only because I enjoy the food. The service is HORRIBLE. The first time I was there it was empty and they told me to wait to be seated even though we had a reservation. Then we didn't get a server for 30 minutes. The second time our sever was rude, unattentive and when we left we saw her outside smoking in front of the hotel, where she must have been the whole time. This last time we had a server who was better than the other two but made a gaggging face when I ordered my lunch and brought us the check when he served us.

When I indicated that we were not done, he brought the dessert menu, took our order (for 4 mini cupcakes) but didn't ask if we wanted coffee or anything else, just brought a revised check back. The mini cupcakes came without small plates or even napkins for us to have as we ate them. When we asked for small plates he seemed quite irritated. Maybe he was in a hurry to get us out of there, but the place was certainly not packed, so we didn't get it.

Our server was fine, but the restaurant was empty and we had bread with no appetizer plates until we asked for them. So there were crumbs all over the table. Not a big deal, just kind of annoying.

We all ordered salads, two Southwest and one wedge. the Southwest salads were Ok.. too many tortilla strips and just iceberg lettuce, for $12. I could get something better at Panera. The Wedge was literally DRIPPING in all kinds of fatty dressings. I get a Wedge to eat a light dinner, not a gallon of blue cheese.

We were all pleasantly surprised by the whole experience -- the place was comfortable, the food delicious and the service exceptional. Our waitperson was knowledgeable, professional and friendly (without being ingratiatingly so). The food was fresh, cooked perfectly and well-presented.

I asked my server and the host multiple times for my bill, explaining that my friend had a flight to catch. I never received a bill and did not get the impression that anyone was checking on our food. Every table around us received their food first, though they came in after us.

the fries that accompanied the burger were really good, but we would have loved the option to substitute either the buffalo fries or the truffle fries at an additional fee.

DiningGal,"Dined on October 7, 2010","Our server was very good - attentive (maybe a little too much so near the end). Wine list was good. Menu was appealing and prices are moderate, which we appreciated. Parmesan truffle fries were fabulous - we ate almost every last one. I had the fish tacos - 3 small tacos in double flour tortillas, served with mixed greens. The fish and guacamole cream tasted great, but the tortillas were downright chewy and tough - hard to bite through two of them. I took the outer layer off and it was easier to eat, but also messier. My companion had the cobb salad which she really enjoyed.

Also don't appreciate when staff stacks up one side of Restaurant so with the banquette style seating I had no place for bags or if it had been cold enough a heavy winter coat.

The fries with buffalo sauce and blue cheese could have been served a bit hotter (both spice level and temperature) but the taste was good. My only complaint is about the fact that the menu online was not the menu featured; this is the second time this has happened to me on OpenTable. I make my reservations based off of specific things I want to try on a menu so if I arrive and the menu is different, there is an automatic declination in my perception of the restaurant because it makes them seem a bit unorganized. Again, what I had was good but it wasn't what I expected.

I had the trout, which was served with grilled grape tomatoes and sliced baby potatoes, and topped with a sprig of watercress. The fish was firm and mild, the veggies added much flavor overall. We went prior to seeing Shrek, and found the atmosphere almost too reserved, as compared with the hopping, happening and hip, bar upstairs, Roof, where we went for cocktails prior.

The polenta with wild boar ragut was really good, was surprised that the dish was gamey, just a little salty for me (I don't use a lot of salt when I cook anyhow) which could have been due to the wild boar. The prawns were also very good and surprisingly very easy to shell. The lunch menu was a bit limited--lots of sandwiches and salads, so I went with the appetizers which had more variety and I was not disappointed. I would go again.

It didn't help that there was a table of 12 behind us near the bar and the more they drank, the louder they became. Our server agreed to move us to another table away from the loud people, but even then it was never quiet enough to have a normal conversation. The attraction at State and Lake is the ""happening bar,"" not the food. After our experience, we have no plans to ever go back and are telling our friends to steer clear.

The calamari steak is also good, very tender, but the only flavor that really comes through is the pepper, leaving whatever else is in the sauce (or even the flavor of the meat) behind.

Service was excellent and prompt, however, making it a good fit for those who want to enjoy a lunch without spending too much time away from the office.

Hap7883,"Dined on February 19, 2010","I would describe the food as comfort food with a twist. They've taken some traditional dishes and kicked them up a notch. I had a grilled cheese sandwich made with gruyere and fresh mozzarella on sourdough bread, and a tomato soup that had bits of bread mixed into it (very rich but not too heavy) with a cup of some of the best coffee around.
The atmosphere is warm and friendly - upscale without being stuffy. The staff is friendly without being interfering. The location is close to so many Chicago landmarks, and in the loop, so I will certainly return for future business or casual lunches.

Food was upscale but simple- no silly flourishes or overdone expressions- just good and straightforward. The seating is close, so perhaps not the best for wanting very private conversations, but the cozy space does lend itself to a lingering lunch and cheerful enjoyment of a special find.

A complimentary dessert for the table would have been a nice gesture. One in our party ordered the trout. It was very good, but that little fish was the only thing on the plate besides the garnish. It was pretty expensive considering what we had. There are too many restaurants in Chicago that are less expensive with the same quality of food, service and ambiance for us to return.

The blue crab toast appetizer (OUTSTANDING!!!) and the wedge salad were terrific starters, and the salmon and short rib entrees were superb, especially the short rib - very meaty and so tender a spoon could cut it. The parmesan truffled fries were delish, and the smoked gouda hushpuppies dense and luscious, particularly with the spicy dipping aioli. The wine list was approachable, but the $11 glass I ordered was a miniscule pour! Our server said all the wines were all 5-oz. pours, but I saw a glass of white wine nearby that was at least 1/4-to-1/2 fuller than my glass. Boo!

Sammy,"Dined on December 19, 2009","We enjoyed our pre-theater dinner very much! First off, our drinks: I had a flight of beer, well worth it at only $7 for a tasting of 3 different brews; my dinner companion had a nice dry sparkling wine. Now, the food: we had fried sea scallops for an appetizer; perfectly textured! Our salad was big enough to share (iceberg wedge) and the accompaniments on the plate (pices of egg and blue cheese) made the dish that much more appealing. Our entrees were the State and Lake burger with havarti cheese and the ""crespelle"", a crepe filled with veggies and bechamel sauce. Both complemented each other nicely. The fries with the burger were too good!
Highly recommend it!!

I have given State and Lake multiple tries after learning that they change their menu approximately once a month. Each and every time I have been generally disappointed. I freely admit that I am a bit of a foodie, but even when dining with friends all of us are generally disappointed. The food seems to lack flavor and excitement.

I truly hope that something changes for the better because the location and decor are great.

The menu is not long: maybe half a dozen ""small plates"" priced in the teens and a similar number of larger entrees in the twenties. Our food was all quite good, certainly justifying the prices. The wine list has lots of items available by the glass, which is always appreciated. Craft beers are a particular feature, listed on a separate menu and available in interesting tasting flights.

(They are located in the heart of Chicago's Theater District and should know by now (they've been open a long time now) that they serve theater-goers and that's what they do.) They ended up seating us 25 minutes late so we had to order as fast as possible. The food definitely took a while to arrive.

It came with 2 small pieces of toast - no potatoes, fruit, not even a garnish. No butter or jam on the table - had to ask and by the time it arrived, our toast was cold.

The food was quite good, with interesting combinations. My only complaint was that I felt it was pricey for the serving sizes. My wife had the wild salmon entree at $26, which was prepared nicely, but was a small piece. In addition to their normal entries they have a ""small plates"" menu, from which I chose Louisiana BBQ shrimp for $14. It was very good. There was a piece of crostini bread, cheedar bacon grits, and three shrimp.

Giant beer menu for beer enthusiasts. The music was too loud for my taste (maybe it's b/c I didn't like the style of music either)",3 stars,Overall 3,Food 3,Service 3,Ambience 3

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 19, 2009","I was excited to try this restaurant but came back disappointed. The service was extremely slow and the waitstaff seemed confused. I was brought a bowl of food twice. I went to lunch with one other person for a nice lunch and coversation. We could not really hear each other due to the noise and the fact that the tables were so close together. It took 45 minutes to get our lunch and I felt like we were being hustled out of there. Portions were small for the price. All in all, a disappointing experience.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 31, 2009","Great beer selection, many from local Midwest brewers. The food was quite good, and the ""small plates"" were quite generous. Two per person was almost too much food. All-in-all, seems like one of the few places to grab a good beer after work in the Loop, and the quality of the food should seal the deal.",4 stars,Overall 4,Food 4,Service 3,Ambience 4

The guys reall enjoyed the beer selection, too.",4 stars,Overall 4,Food 5,Service 4,Ambience 4
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 26, 2009","This place has great ambiance, and good food. The prices weren't too bad considering its upscale feel. The service was a little weird; I think they are still trying to figure it out. Out waitress was really nice though! We were there dining with a group of 6, and we did appetizers and small plates, and it was great! Don't miss the pork shoulder and mac & cheese, DELICIOUS!",4 stars,Overall 4,Food 4,Service 3,Ambience 4

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 25, 2009","Comfortable, cozy, maybe a little too dark inside. Food was very good, dessert being a standout. Service was friendly and not at all rushed. A neighboring group kept encroaching on our space, trying to fit more than designed at their table. Restaurant took care of the situation and it was only a minor annoyance, and I don't think it was their fault anyway. Overall a very good dining experience and we would definitely return.

ValerieO,"Dined on July 23, 2009","I was expecting better food after this place was hyped up but it did not deliver. The flavors were flat and the only thing that helped me finish my plate was the fact that I was very hungry. I think if the prices were reduced, my expectations would have been lower and I would have been more satisfied. Overall, the scene was great and energetic - the cocktails were delicous but food fell flat.

beth4158,"Dined on July 20, 2009","As much as I couldn't stop gushing over my first experience with State and Lake (for pre-theater dinner), I was disappointed on my return visit for lunch with a friend in town on business. Bright spots included the lemonade, which is clearly made with real lemons (though it could use a touch more sugar or simple syrup; it was surprisingly tart) and the chunks of lobster in the lobster bisque, though the bisque itself wasn't the best I've had. And it bears mentioning that our server, Jesus, did everything he could to make us happy. But the short-rib panini was so dry as to be almost inedible. We asked for the chef to provide something for dipping, and he provided some of the braising liquid, which was of great help. Still, a let-down.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 4, 2009","We went to State and Lake based on the NY Times article on where to find specialty beers. They had a nice selection of beers and some really decent food to go with it. We had kids with us and they were accomodated just fine. We felt a little out of place without ""club attire"" on and with the kids but not uncomfortable. They had a good selection of seafood and other food that paired well with beer. I would recommend it especially if you were up for eating late and taking part in the late night bar scene.

yummyummy,"Dined on July 3, 2009","My friends & I had lunch 7/3. 3 of us ordered the Cuban sandwich, 1 person ordered the calamari salad and 1 ordered the omelet. The Cuban sandwich is ginormous... absolutely huge!!! Was good, but not best and could have come with more roast pork than ham. I really liked the parm-garlic fries even tho' I didn't taste the garlic, but I would def order them again. My friend who had the calamari salad enjoyed it, but it wasn't spectacular and was just the right size. As for the omelet - DO NOT ORDER! It's like they used one egg and put chopped veggies in it. It was miniscule and def not worth $12. The presentation was awful. Should be an appetizer not an entree. The service was good, waiter was fun. Would go back, but not a rush.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 22, 2009","I went to the Wit on a whim and didnt like ""the roof"" vibe- It was a Sunday ppm- so we were to State and Lake and sat at the bar. Virginia the bartender was nice, knowledgeable & a great asset to the company. Our server was ok, but thanks to Virginia, we stayed for dinner. Braised ribs were dry, but the scallops were great and the trout had a great broth. Overall an ok experience for a Sunday dinner.

MNinChI,"Dined on June 14, 2009","Great food that was reasonably priced. Very creative menu, but not so foreign that you were afraid to try it. The pork shoulder was crazy tender, and all of the 6 diners at our table were happy with their dishes. We didn't have any apps other than the beet salad, which was great. Pistachio ice cream was very yummy. Only concern was the beer selection - none were recognizable for those who wanted a good ol' American brew.

AndreaD,"Dined on June 11, 2009","The only bad thing here is the drink pouring. They offer 1/2 glasses of wine (seriously!?) but the ""full"" glass looks a lot like 1/2 to me! At Roof as well as State & Lake they seem to be measuring every ounce of alcohol they serve - a bit on the stingy side for the prices! If you like good comfort food, this is your place! The buffalo fries we had to be talked in to, but they were delish and they were devoured by our table. The mac & cheese w/ pork shoulder dish was like pork roast from Mom and a side of mac & cheese that was delectible! A few healthier options would make me happy, but it's a good variety either way. The toasted almonds app was also tasty!!! It's nice to head up to Roof after dinner for a great view & drinks.
