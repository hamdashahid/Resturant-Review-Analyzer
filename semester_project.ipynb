The staff was EXEMPLARY! ... Very polite, the manager on duty did apologize for the food not being hot/satisfactory and offered complimentary glasses of wine. I appreciated that VERY much! Doubt if I'll be returning and won't be recommending this restaurant! So sorry!\\nRead more\",\n",

       "  'Thanksgiving menu review - Good customer service experience, we were sat early for our reservation. But the prefix menu was inaccurate and misleading. The “seafood bar” was a depressing shrimp salad and some lox salmon, and the menu didn’t mention asparagus coming with the prime rib and if I had known that was the case I would have asked if there were any alternatives. Overall just not worth the price, I could have gotten an a full sized prime rib for $20 less at a number of places downtown.\\nRead more',\n",

The food was excellent! Highly recommend the roasted Brussels sprouts with dates. The chicken breast with bacon bread pudding and apple reduction was phenomenal. The sauce was almost like they had liquefied a caramel apple.  Our drinks were good if a bit on the higher price side, but that is to be expected given the locations.

Others (smaller groups) who came after us, were seated in the area by the bar and were finished eating before we even received our food. Not sure if it was a server problem, kitchen problem or both. We did receive a discount on our food, but it was not a good experience. Couldn’t even enjoy the food because we had to eat it so quickly.

We came early at 5:00 and the restaurant was not busy. We had to flag down  an employee for service although they had taken notice of us, no one approached us. We asked  politely who our server was and she said “I can be your server”. It appeared as if they did not know who was responsible for what tables. After that we were constantly looking for service. Hostess stepped up to get us utensils and drink order. Overheard the table next to us ask server if the food was coming as they had to make a show. Had already been waiting awhile. When food still hadn’t appeared, he said to his wife we have to go. He was quite unhappy and told the server to  cancel his order.

I am not clear which alcohol was used in my drink, but the quality was definitely not price comparable. I was seated where the prepared food was placed and noticed two orders of French fries. I asked the bartender if she could check to see if they were mine. She looked at the tickets and stated I had a few orders ahead of mines.

However, we arrived early for our 630 reservation, and they were able to seat us early, around 6:05.  Our server did not ask if we had questions and was not very personable.  Our appetizer and drinks arrived really fast after ordering.  However, our entrees never arrived, and at 7:00, my friend flagged down the waiter to see what the issue was and to tell him we had concert tickets.  He checked with the kitchen and told us they had made a mistake.  Our food arrived piping hot 10 min later.  As mentioned, the food was great.  Our server offered to comp us another round of drinks or dessert to make up for the error.  Obviously, we could not do this as we needed to get to the theater for our show.  What irritates me is that he did not comp the drinks we had already ordered.  We should have just asked for a manager, obviously.  Our bill was $150 dollars for a 15 percent tip, 2 entrees, 3 drinks, and 1 app.  Pretty expensive considering we had to wait 45 min for our entrees.  Disappointing.\\nRead more',\n",

The place is beautiful, but has a tavern ambience, so it was a bit dark for a breakfast or lunch--however we knew that going into it, so mentioning it for others who wouldn't like it. \\n\\nThe food was cooked very well although my breakfast potatoes were a bit undercooked, enough that I noticed it. The bacon and eggs were perfect though! \\n\\nThe reason I would hesitate to return is lack of service. We sat for about 10 minutes, maybe more, and had to ask for someone to come take our orders. We received our food by someone else, then we noticed there wasn't any salt or pepper on any of the tables, even though there were jars of jelly and sweeteners. We couldn't get anyone's attention, so I went to the bar and asked for S&P. A bit later the server came back to refill our water, but didn't ask about my iced tea. When I was ready for more, again, I could not get anyone's attention, so I got the bartender's attention and asked for a refill. This is three times we had to flag someone down just for basic, normal aspects of dining at a restaurant. \\n\\nService will make or break a place, and at times like these when patrons such as us are extending patience and understanding to understaffed businesses, it's just as important for staff to show patrons they are glad their establishment was chosen. We counted more staff than patrons too--we were #7 and #8, and there were more than 8 on staff, and the manager passed by our table many times and never looked our way.\\nRead more\",\n",

We were seated right away when the host finally arrived.  It took a very long time for the server to arrive.  He stopped by our table and acknowledged us and said he'd be back in 2 minutes.  When he finally arrived we ordered drinks and food at once.  Drinks and food (burger and mussels) were good.  My husband was able to order a second drink but the server never came back to check on us again and later I did want to order another.  I thought we could order desert but the server gave us the check not giving dessert as an option.  He said sorry if you wanted another drink and if I took too long.

My dining companion's was cold, and I was served regular coffee instead of decaf.  Perhaps the cups were inadvertently switched on the way to the table? Whatever it was, I thought I would jump out of my skin (I am extremely caffeine sensitive), and couldn't sleep all night. Yes, I would recommend the restaurant, just make sure you're getting what you ordered!\\nRead more\",\n",

They’re in tune enough to ask if you’re seeing a show, presumably to keep you on task if you can’t keep yourself on task.  Our reservation was for 5:15 and our show was 7:30, that gave us plenty of time to lazily make our way through 2 cocktails and to appetizers prior to ordering our entrees.  Recommend the Burrata & House made Guanciale as a cold starter, the Aged Cheddar Soft Pretzel as a hot start, the 72 Hr Local Short Rib “Steak” & the Pork Tenderloin Schnitzel as mains.  Would recommend reservations - we arrived about 20 mins early for ours, figuring we’d just sit at the bar before the reservation time & the place was empty but for about 6 ppl at the bar, but the hostess brought us right to the table.

The restaurant was fairly empty, but it took forever to get so much as a glass of water, let alone service.  The waitress was pleasant when she finally arrived.  Apparently there was a run on pretzels because they were out of that appetizer item.  I ordered a cosmo and it was pretty bad.  There was vodka and tequila in it, which I have never heard of.  I even Googled it and couldn’t find a cosmo recipe with vodka and tequila.  My husband had a beer and said it was under carbonated.  Since they were out of the pretzel, we just ordered dinner.  The burger was fine, although it had a surprising smokey flavor.  Overall just meh.\\nRead more',\n",

Tables were a bit small, hard to get shared appetizers in the table and still have room for drinks.   Ordered mixed drinks that were very good, wish they were a few dollars cheaper and you would have had me for a third round.  Food was good, portions were average.  Overall I left satisfied, but for the higher prices I was hoping for either a bigger portion, way more flavor or a winning atmosphere.  The bar noise on a Thursday was a bit much by 9pm and it was tough to get to the restrooms as the bar crowd was shoulder to shoulder across the only aisle-way.  Service was good, time from order to food on the table was very prompt.  I was hoping for some specials or seasonal items but there weren't any.  I wasn't overly impressed with the menu.  It focused for on appetizers then main course.  Overall this is a great place for a really good mixed drink at the bar and some tasty apps...but I don't think I'll be back for a full meal.\\nRead more\",\n",

The creamy apple mustard was almost buttery and the grainy mustard added just enough to add a bit of spice. My sister and both got the short rib. The meat was so tender.

The kids meals were amazing for both dinner and breakfast! No complaints there.  Adult breakfast meals were just meh.  Adult dinner meals were not good.  I have never sent a meal back, if I was that kind of person, I would've sent back my risotto.  It was AWFUL! Completely watery, flavors were bad.  We shared the pea pierogi and that was also not good.  The flavors did not work together.  I'm a polish girl from Pennsylvania, so I was excited for a pierogi.  Needless to say, we were extremely disappointed.  My husband got the roasted chicken.  The chicken was good but again, the sides were not up to par.  We ended up eating my daughter's mac and cheese. It's also worth noting that the man next to us sent back his pancakes at breakfast.  You would think pancakes would be a safe bet, right?

I had also mentioned in my reservation that we would be in a bit of a hurry since we were going to the show and also that it was my friends birthday but the server didn’t mention either of those things which makes me think she wasn’t told, which would be on management if that’s the case. I wasn’t expecting s free dessert or anything special like that but a simple acknowledgement (hey happy birthday) would have been nice.

I would not recommend the place on a weekend night as the Loop really empties out and the feel was really transient tourists rather than a loyal local following.  The food was good (the burger and the pasta, and the pretzels and trout spread for starters, and the Old Fashioned are terrific) but a little high-priced for what you got.  I think the most disappointing aspects are 1) Ambience: the feel is dark, a little loud, and very impersonal - kind of like eating in a railroad station pub.  2) Service: no real welcome from the hostess, and then our waitress sloshed a bunch of beer when she put one of our glasses on the table and didn't even apologize let alone return to clean it up, so we got a napkin from another table to do just that.  She may have been terribly overworked or distracted but she was not a good fit for the hospitality business for sure.

You can enter the restaurant through the hotel lobby (which overlooks the State Lake \"L\" platform) or through the restaurant\\'s own State Street entrance.  The menu is limited, but has everything for a burger to entrees, plus a variety of bar plates (they get an after work bar crowd.)  Entrees were much better than I anticipated and fairly priced.  Cocktails were expensive (downtown hotel rates) but well-made and generous.  Good beer options.  Atmosphere is casual but comfortable.  We were there during March Madness and there were too many TV screens for my taste -- but I\\'ve been there at other times and learned that the TVs retractable (they actually retract into the walls when there are no major events).\\nRead more',\n",

Considering there were lines of people waiting to get into many restaurants/ bars in downtown Chicago, we considered ourselves lucky to get a reservation for our group. \\n\\nWe arrived a few minutes early and the restaurant had several available tables, but we still had a 10 minute wait until we were seated (after 5 minutes of waiting, they cleared off and cleaned a large table for 8 people that had been unused at the time of our arrival). Our server seemed like he was having a stressful day (which is understandable, considering we were downtown in Chicago on St. Patrick's Day), but was not very attentive to our table and always seemed to be in a hurry with us, even though there were a lot of open tables and the restaurant didn't seem slammed. \\n\\nMultiple times throughout the meal, the Handicap door entrance to the restaurant (which was right next to our table) was opened, which forced the cold air from outside into our faces at the table (it was around 30 degrees outside at the time of our meal). One time, it was opened by two members of the restaurant staff who needed to dump a large trough of ice outside... VERY cold...\\n\\nAll in all, I think that our experience was not great, but that under different circumstances and with a few tweaks, it could have been a lot better.\\nRead more\",\n",

All the while, no spoons at the table so my colleagues were using their knives and forks to stir their coffee. Placed our order. Asked for spoons. Spoons delivered. Order delivered except for the toast. Halfway through our meals, still no toast. Beckoned the waiter who said he'd check on the toast right away. Brought the toast. Explained the delay due to bread being downstairs in freezer. What?! We had to ask for butter. He brought the butter, explaining that the butter isn't gluten free so they don't put it on gluten free toast. What?! I questioned that and he said that's what the chef says. That waiter disappeared. We literally didn't see him again. Host came to fill our water glasses and explains that they don't butter the gluten free toast because frequently guests who order gluten free also are dairy free. Fine. Or, I suggested, your could ask the guests when they order. She said that's why the waiter brings butter separately. Yes, I said, after you ask for it. Again, great food.

While some other places have been chintzie with the amount they give you, both boards were surprisingly generous. I had one of their Manhattans (North and West?) which was good although a bit pricey. For dinner, I had the pork chop and my husband had the bison meatloaf. The pork chop was really juicy and tasty although it was a bit difficult to cut into while it was atop beans (also tasty) in a skillet. I ended up launching some beans onto the saucer for the skillet. My husband really enjoyed his meatloaf and was very pleased with his choice.

Food was generally good - my wife had the meatloaf which was excellent; I had the perch tacos which were so-so. Service was disappointing - we waited for anyone to show up to take our drink order and waited again to take our food order. Once our food order went in, we never saw our waiter again until he handed us the bill. Once ordered, our food came out quickly but the wait staff seemed focused on a couple of larger, after-work crowd tables and generally ignored us.\\nRead more',\n",

We were seated quickly, next to the floor to ceiling windows facing State Street, with nice views all around.  Even though we were between two other parties, it didn't feel crowded and it was easy to have a private conversation.  My wife asked for some extras beyond the menu descriptions (change to a cocktail ingredient, additional dipping item for the delicious pimento cheese spread), and she was accommodated without hesitation.  Our main courses, steak and one of their signature burgers, were perfectly done.  And our side potatoes, mashed and hand cut fries, also were very tasty.  \\nThe only slight drawback was that our waiter was not as attentive as he could have been after the meal was served, but one of his fellow waiters jumped in to check on us.

Meanwhile the rest of our party showed up; our drinks came after another 10-minute wait. We ordered our food ASAP and actually made some revisions because our server warned us that some of the items took longer. The meal didn't come for over a half-hour, even though we DIDN'T order the items that he warned would take up to 20-minutes! The burger was good, fish tacos were terrible, roasted cauliflower was not cooked enough (too hard to chew) but we had no time to waste so we didn't send anything back (except the extra fish tacos that we didn't even order?). After flagging down any server for our bill, we were surprised to see that they had charged us for the extra fish tacos that we never ordered, AND they had tacked on 20% gratuity!. Given the fact that we received terrible service and the food was not good, I resent the automatic 20% gratuity.

We started with cocktails, which were spot on, and then moved on to the cheese and charcuterie plate, which was excellent. Our server was fantastic, striking just the right balance between friendly and professional. She did a great job of pacing our meal so that we weren't rushed but we also weren't waiting for our food. The only thing I didn't like was that my entree was waaaay over salted. I like salt, and I have nothing against it, but I had the pork chop with sauteed greens on the side, and both were so salty that I couldn't finish it.

The veggies were slightly over-salted for my taste, but still good. The service was a bit slow - we probably would have ordered another round of drinks or dessert, but the server didn't come back around after the first round. What we did get was very good. They had live music which was great. The only downside to that is there was some kind of piano bar thing going on upstairs that was drowning out the singer downstairs. Overall - wonderful experience.

I asked our waitress for a spoon to drink the awesome broth that the mussels were in. We thoroughly enjoyed both the mussels and the breaded smelt. I thought the pickled okra served with the smelt were an interesting taste that I hadn't had before and look forward to having again. We then split the cheese curd burger with sweet potato fries. The fries were surprisingly different. They were panko breaded and not mushy, but rather firm to the bite, which was an interesting texture that we really enjoyed. I think they should think about using the panko breading for the smelt. Great food and great service!\\nRead more\",\n",

We waited waited and waited for our food and finally it arrived. The appetizer and the meal was brought to the table at the same time. The appetizer had 2 pieces of (baby sized) thighs and the amish chicken...although it had flavor, I think the seasoning didnt get into the meat. I also believe that it was a little under cooked as it was a little on the pink side in a few spots over all the waiter was pretty helpful and did pretty good with service but the food and host (service) probably can use a little work!\\nRead more',\n",

I was wrong. We both ordered the grass fed burger, he ordered it medium rare and I got mine medium well. His was STRAIGHT UP RAW and not even warm. He loves a rare burger and this was still too raw for him. Mine was very rare and slightly warm. The meal had potential if it was cooked. We waited for our waitress to come back to see if they can cook it more. We waited and waited. We ate part of one of the halves. By the time she came we were on on the verge of nausea because it was so slimy and mushy. Sorry for the description. She asked if we wanted to wait and get a new burger but we were doing a meet and greet for a concert and had to leave. I feel she should\\'ve given it for half the price or comped it.

It was followed by the mushroom toast appetizer. I liked it but felt it was missing a zing to get the otherwise mild flavor to pop. My beef cheek bourginonne was excellent, although it arrived at the table a bit tepid - I suspect it was waiting around while my wife\\'s sirloin was getting overcooked. We asked that they take it back and try again, which they did without hesitation (and they got it right the second time). We split the apple donut dessert, which we thought was spectacular... nice and crispy outside, fluffy and light inside, with a sweet sauce on the side that complemented them perfectly. It was not very busy so the background noise level was quite low. I forget how much I enjoy going out in New Haven when the hubbub of Yale dies down in the summer...\\nRead more',\n",

There was hardly any customers there. Someone could have helped is our server was busy.  Our bill came…. 120 something, and my mom forgot to order coffee.  She ordered a cup of decaf and instead of letting it go… he added it to the bill. After a wrong order, slow service, a comped cup of coffee would have been a decent jester.

While the restaurant was fairly empty, service was slow and inattentive. Our food took a long time to arrive, and once it did arrive, the reason was clear. It had been sitting around waiting for our server to bring it to us. Thus, my medium rare steak was now a slightly chilled medium with a side of room temperature vegetables. I sent it back and the server graciously took it away without making a fuss. If the restaurant were busy or understaffed, it would have been more understandable, but there wasn’t any clear reason for the poor service. We’ll be returning for brunch, and I’m hoping last night was just an anomaly.

       "  \"We have made several visits to Heirloom and like it very much. The space is lovely, the service is good, the menu choices are excellent, and the value for this level of quality is outstanding. Our recent Sunday brunch was no exception. Our party of 4 was engaged in conversation and the waitperson was respectful until we signaled we could order. She was prompt and efficient. Our food was great. The Carmel Apple Doughnut appetizer was a total home run. Crazy tasty! Three of the four had Benedict options and each was enthusiastic about the food. The fresh biscuit instead of an English muffin was great. My burger was prepared perfectly to order. The cost for four without alcohol was a very reasonable $107 (without tip) for an excellent dining experience. The only downside was not being offered dessert. We were presented with the check before asking which we took as a signal we overstayed our welcome. That was uncharacteristic for me and not a good impression. Still, overall, an outstanding experience and we'll be back.\\nRead more\",\n",

Bouillabaisse was good, but Shell & Bones has a bouillabaisse that’s a bit better. Kale salad with “sour” cherry vinaigrette was pretty sweet and the sweetness built with each bite. Definitely wouldn’t have ordered if I realized how sweet it was. Didn’t even look at the dessert menu because I was afraid if a kale salad was moderately sugary and sweet that an actual dessert would be unbearably saccharine.\\nRead more',\n",

My brunch companion loved his banana french toast and I had some. It was tasty. But my smoked salmon benedict was all cold except for the eggs. One of the eggs was poached perfectly, the other, the yolk was entirely cooked through. The hollandaise was too lemony, too yolky- fine, but a little different from what I expected, and again, cold. Not lukewarm. Cold. And I get that they're proud of their biscuits. I do. But a benedict doesn't belong on anything with a cake-like texture. It just crumbled and made the whole thing mealy, while the biscuit itself got soggy. Also, my companion ordered tea, was asked four different questions about how he would like it, and it never came.\\nRead more\",\n",

Although the bartender described it as \"kind of a reverse popper\", it was definitely up several levels from that and much more interesting for the palate.  Very tasty.  I wish there was a simple greens salad on the menu (healthy, light), which would have made a nice combo to start.  \\n\\nWe had IPAs at the bar, but very nice bartender also served us a complimentary gin drink with rosemary that was quite delicious. \\n\\nWould come here again for the food in a heartbeat.

He continued to rush us through our Thanksgiving meal and informed us at the end that he was sorry, but he had a celebration to get home to. Well, that was our family Thanksgiving celebration too. It was non-traditional this year and we were making the best of it. If you don't want people sitting down at a time, don't offer that time for reservations. Food was good, not fabulous. They forgot the cranberry sauce with our thanksgiving plates. This was anticipated as the highlight of our day and it turned into the opposite. We had more fun playing board games and sipping our coffees at Starbucks.\\nRead more\",\n",

My husband and I were staying at The Study for our 28th anniversary and decided to have dinner downstairs at Heirloom.  Big mistake.  The evening started out promisingly, with decent martinis and a delicious chicken liver pâté.  And then we waited for our main course. And waited. And waited. And waited.  At least 30 minutes with no acknowledgement of the delay.  After the waitress had finally come by to tell us it would be “a couple more minutes,” and many many many more minutes had passed after that, with other servers offering to check, we finally got our meal... with no apology.  Our only offer of compensation was an espresso on the house, which we declined. At that point we only wanted to get out of there.  And we will most certainly never be back.\\nRead more',\n",

Strangely, my sandwich and salad arrived along with her french fries but NO sandwich for her. Hmmmm? A bus boy delivered the food, and our waitress was not around. She finally checked in about half way through my sandwich and promised to ask in the kitchen, and acted like this wasn't a problem. About 15 minutes later, her sandwich arrived. No apologies, just an extra side salad, which my friend didn't really want t this point. I have to say, the sandwiches were huge, but not really a traditional grilled melt. The cheese was melted, but it was so thick it was really messy and the tuna was cold. I ate mine with a fork. The salad was drenched in a tart lemony vinaigrette dressing. I have dined there before and it was good but they were off their game this time. With so many great restaurants in NH, I don't know if I'd return.\\nRead more\",\n",

       "  'We ate at Heirloom Saturday night. It is a beautiful looking restaurant  great ambience, attentive servers, and good food. The only issue was it took a very long time to get our food.  I don’t know if there were kitchen issues that night but we were there for over 2 hours and weren’t drinking.  Our orders were pretty simple. Yet the food took forever, to the point where the server acknowledged the fact and they offered us free dessert which we accepted and then regretted b/c then the dessert took over 20 mins to come out! \\nSo I’m not sure how to rate Heirloom.  Food was good (when we got it), servers were great, ambience also great.  So if you don’t mind waiting for your food this is a wonderful place. Reasonable prices, good food.  Slow kitchen\\nRead more',\n",

Although our server was very friendly, she was hard to find when we needed her. We ordered drinks and apps. We wanted to wait till the apps arrived , then order dinner. But the apps took so long the waitress came several times to take our order. \\nThe cheese sampler was very good with a wonderful honey comb on the side, and the smoked trout amazing. However the smoked trout was a good sized serving, but it was served with three slices of bread- weird. I guess we could have made sandwiches!\\nDinner took about 30 minutes plus to arrive after that. The Shrimp dish pasta was extremely undercooked. Thought the shrimp were good I was told, both who ordered it only ate the shrimp. The scallops were superb. The gnocchi was very good, though there was a very faint taste of flour. \\n\\nAs the whole meal took such a long time we decided against the dessert.\\n\\nThe concept is great and the potential there- but it was just so off I will not go again.\\nRead more',\n",

Their menu is very interesting and offers wonderful combinations.  The appetizers were very flavorful.  I had salmon which was cooked perfectly and had a great combination of vegetables and rice.  The salmon  was a little on the bland side though.  My husband had steak.  He was a bit disappointed because it was fatty but he is very picky.

       "  \"This is a reasonably expensive restaurant and the quality of the food does not match the price. My crudite with hummus was a bowl of vegetables--so if you favored one vegetable in particular, you'd have to search for it-- with a practically inedible hummus (The main spices seemed to have been chili pepper and paprika) My duck breast was tough and the vegetables fairly tasteless. My husband's martini was, in his words, below par and so was his fish dish. I think the food was so mediocre, I would not even go to the restaurant again to give it a second chance.  And seriously, when I order DRY sherry, I don't expect the wait person to bring me what I am pretty sure was very sweet port with a cherry draped over the edge of the glass.\\nRead more\",\n",

The servers are unfailingly polite, but about every third time I visit the restaurant something goes very wrong with the timing of the service. This last time, our party ordered cocktails, and since we had also decided on our food, we ordered it at the same time.  Our starters arrived about 10 minutes after we ordered, then our cocktails arrived about 5 minutes later - not the way one expects a gracious and relaxing dinner to go.  Our main courses arrived at least 1 hour after our starters, which we had finished 45 minutes earlier.  In the meantime, we were given another complimentary starter to share, and at the end of the meal (when two of us had to leave due to the hour) we were brought a medley of complimentary desserts.  We appreciated the effort to \"make it up to us,\" but bringing additional food that diners did not order and may not want is no substitute for delivering on what is expected in the first place.  These lapses may be due to the kitchen being overwhelmed by private dinners elsewhere in the hotel (the dining room has never been very full when they occur), but the restaurant needs to figure out a way to deal with whatever so often causes this problem.\\nRead more',\n",

Two other couples sat at that rocking table during our stay.\\nFood was generally good, my wife was unable to eat more than a few bites of her salad, as the dressing was unfathomably spicey, and had not been noted that way in the menu. Also, she ordered 6 oysters, and was served 3, which turned out to be fine, but still...\\nProtein portions were good, but the advertised accompaniments were tiny - like a tablespoon of squash, and three small mushrooms.\\nEarly on, we indicated we were in no rush, when asked if we had theater plans.  Service was OK, but not very attentive throughout the meal.  However, when it came time to order and receive dessert - the wait was interminable. Mine was premade with a scoop of icecream on top, and my wife\\'s was 3 fried donut balls. Nothing elaborate that would justify the wait.\\nOverall, not sure this was worth the cost.

The seating does not give you a personal feel, having bench seats down the wall and sitting couples on a romantic evening right next to eachother with a sparsely seated dining room.  Food selection was heavy on seafood with the only steak option a $36 dry aged steak, which was just ok on flavor.  Wine selection was outstanding and the server had a very good knowledge of the wines.  For a $155 food and wine bill (1 bottle @ 60), I believe there are much nicer restaurants out there.\\nRead more',\n",

I ordered Grilled cheese w/fires, my husband go the burger w/tomato soup and we ordered a spinach and artichoke dip appetizer along with two sodas.  The total was about $54.00 \\n\\nThe service was extremely slow with no waitstaff even on the floor should you need something.  We were immediately seated and our drinks taken. Then about 5 - 10 min later we placed our orders.  It took slightly longer then normal to receive our food but we were ok with that.  However after we received our food we did not see anyone again.  No one checked in to see how things were or if we needed anything else.  We waited a good 25 minutes after finishing our lunch before even getting the attention of someone.  All we wanted was to wrap the left overs & get the check.  The table next to us who was there before us was also waiting for their check.  They were ready to just walk out at one point.  \\n\\nIt was not busy maybe 6 - 10 tables with about 4 staff members working who all just hung out in the coffee bar area chatting.  We were looking around for anyone grab our waiters attention but as we looked around there was not one waitstaff member on the floor walking around.  It was not until my husband started staring over at the coffee bar someone finally came over and asked if we needed something. \\n\\nI would say the overall experience was less the expected.  The restaurant is located in the Yale University district  located by tons of amazing restaurants within the same price range. From the info online and the location we expected more.  Based on the wait time and the food quality compared to price we would probably not visit again.   \\n\\nOn a positive side the restaurant it self is located in a nice are close to shopping, gallery, theaters and hotel.  The decor and space is very nice and may be great for a late night social for some cocktails and apps.\\nRead more',\n",

The first place that popped up was Heirloom, the restaurant located in The Study in the Yale Hotel. Even though I was born and raised in New Haven, I knew little about the restaurant. When we entered the restaurant, we were impressed by its look and feel. We were seated quickly and presented with menus and water. We ordered specialty cocktails, a Paper Plane and a Moonshine Lemonade, that were both delicious and larger than other fine dining places. The bread was served with a horseradish mayonnaise spread that was fantastic. For appetizers we ordered the Baked Clams and the Roasted Oysters which were on a nice, spicy ragu. They arrived at our table hot, which I love, They were both fabulous. For entrees we ordered the Fried Clam Risotto and the Baked Chicken. We also ordered a very nice Williamette Valley Pinot Noir. We also ordered the Sweet and Sour Broccoli that came with a great Mable and White Soy Sauce. Again they were right from the oven and fabulous. Alexander, our fabulous waiter, also gave us a taste of a great Spanish wine whose name escapes me. As usual, I had to have dessert and coffee. I ordered the Pana Cotta and it was perfect. With the very good, food, service and ambiance, we will certainly be back.\\nRead more',\n",

       "  \"We get together with friends from Fairfield (CT) just before Christmas every year in New Haven, which is halfway from our home in Cromwell. It was my first time at Heirloom, although my husband has had Yale-related business luncheons there and has spoken favorably about the venue. The validated valet parking was a plus, as street parking in downtown New Haven can often be tricky; at the conclusion of the meal, we gave the ticket to the server and our car was waiting for us as we exited the building. Our OpenTable reservation was immediately honored and we were seated at an attractive table for four. My only complaint here is that the restaurant is very dark -- on a winter evening, it was hard to read the menu and pay the check at the conclusion of the meal. My husband had as an appetizer the wedge salad, which he quite enjoyed; I had four shrimp, which I didn't much care for -- they didn't have the steakhouse flavor (e.g., Morton's) that I prefer. My husband had the steak and mashed potatoes, which he liked; I had the gnocchi, as did one of our friends, and we liked the subtle flavor and the portion size; the fourth member of our party had the salmon, which he seemed to enjoy -- there was certainly nothing left on his plate. The bread was quite crusty/chewy, which is always a plus. We didn't have coffee or dessert. All in all, it was a very good meal. The acid test: would I go back? Yes, we have already made plans to meet again there on December 14, 2019, for our annual pre-holiday dinner. [We were in a bit of a hurry, so the server discouraged us from getting the chicken, which she said could take 35 - 45 to prepare, which seemed somewhat extraordinary, but we appreciated the heads up.]\\nRead more\",\n",

Something rare to find in new haven, a busy place that you can still have a conversation in. \\n\\nAnyway, I will MOST definitely return.\\nRead more',\n",

The restaurant was not crowded but the service was slow - this visit we waited almost an hour for our food. I think they forgot our order because when we asked about it we had to wait another 15 minutes. Then the food wasn’t great - the “frittata” was cooked egg whites with cheese and raw kale dumped on top. Soggy toast.  Fruit plate was melon and a few grapes.\\nRead more',\n",

The first place that popped up was Heirloom, the restaurant located in The Study in the Yale Hotel. Even though I was born and raised in New Haven, I knew little about the restaurant. When we entered the restaurant, we were impressed by its look and feel. We were seated quickly and presented with menus and water. We ordered specialty cocktails, a Paper Plane and a Moonshine Lemonade, that were both delicious and larger than other fine dining places. The bread was served with a horseradish mayonnaise spread that was fantastic. For appetizers we ordered the Baked Clams and the Roasted Oysters which were on a nice, spicy ragu. They arrived at our table hot, which I love, They were both fabulous. For entrees we ordered the Fried Clam Risotto and the Baked Chicken. We also ordered a very nice Williamette Valley Pinot Noir. We also ordered the Sweet and Sour Broccoli that came with a great Mable and White Soy Sauce. Again the were right from the oven and fabulous. Alexander, our fabulous waiter, also gave us a taste of a great Spanish wine whose name escapes me. As usual, I had to have dessert and coffee. I ordered the Pana Cotta and it was perfect. With the very good, food, service and ambiance, we will certainly be back.\\nRead more',\n",

The ambiance is terrific, as are the cocktails and wine list. We were celebrating our 6th wedding anniversary, and they treated us to a dessert flight that was just out of this world! It was such a nice touch. On another visit, the service was a little slow at times, and it seemed that perhaps they were understaffed a bit, but overall, we have had very pleasant experiences, and will definitely be returning!\\nRead more',\n",

Our server was soooo bad that I thought I was on a hidden camera show. I could make this long, but here are four highlights--1. They were out of four lunch items on the menu. 2. The burger that I ordered medium came out with a blood saturated bun. I cut into burger and the inside was raw. She told me that is their medium (I have ordered this before and never had raw meat served as medium). I can handle a burger from medium rare to well, so if I can't eat it hen there's a problem. I asked her to have them throw it back on and it came back well. 3. I ordered an iced tea. She never refilled it or even offered to fill it in over an hour. I moved the glass to the far left on the table to make it super visible...with no luck. 4. We waited 25 minutes after we were finished eating before she brought out our check. \\n\\nI want to love this place.

       "  \"For the first time we were disappointed at Heirloom. Though it tends to be a little pricey for us, we usually find the quality of the food justifies it for a special occasion meal. But this time the food was merely OK, perhaps because it was the prix-fixe Restaurant Week menu. The pork confit was definitely too heavy. We splurged on oysters as a first course; they were fine but not the best in town. The real disappointment was the service, which was slow and incompetent. Waiter had trouble opening the wine, which turned out to be a bad bottle anyway. An alternative wine could not be suggested (even by the manager). In the end it took over 20 minutes to be served a bottle of reasonable Cabernet Sauvignon. One of the appetizer orders was botched (leading to further delay), and in the end we were brought the wrong bill for the meal. Though it's a minor point, I found it annoying to have my bread plate cleared before I was done with it -- though other unneeded service items were left on the table until the end of the meal.\\nRead more\",\n",

We had delicious, simple appetizers to start (smoked fish, warm ricotta, etc), but then we ran out of bread and asked for more -- it took more than 10 minutes to get another plate of italian bread.  So the food is excellent, but the theme is spotty service which continued through dinner. Everyone enjoyed their main courses (scallops, lamb ragu, beet risotto) but then toward the end of our meal our server just disappeared.   There was a manager looking guy who came around occasionally but in the end we were finished for 20-30 minutes before we could get our check.  So, really great food, interesting and well priced wine, but I'd say the professionalism of the servers and service (only our waitress spoke english it seemed so other staff couldn't be very helpful) marred the experience.  We'd still go back for the food I think, but with different expectations about how demanding we need to be to get what we want in terms of service.

They were good in accommodating  us and cooking his eggs in butter.  I finally ordered a simple breakfast when nothing else seemed appealing.  We frequent farm to table restaurants all the time and felt this place was trying too hard. Though the idea was good, the ingredients should have been a bit more simple.

We wanted to eat slowly so that we just had time together and she was very open to this.

We were not rushed to order anything else and when we did we all loved our various dishes - chicken salad, burger, salad nicoise - which I was told was the best nicoise ever.

My husband had never been to this restaurant, while I had been several times for work and had been impressed with both the food and service.  It was meant to be a special occasion.  I realize it was New Year's Eve, when restaurants may find it difficult to be fully staffed, but I greatly regretted this visit.  The food was average, and the service was poor.  Of the dishes the halibut was the best.  The appetizers were poor: the octopus was rubbery (frozen?) and the oysters so small and flavorless that it seemed we had paid $3 for each little spoonful of tomato garnish.  The duck was tough, and the kale salad dressing so sweet that it wasn't really edible.  As for service, I think the restaurant was really short-staffed.  We asked for another lime half for the appetizers, as the first was one was dessicated that no juice came out.  It never came.  We asked for the salad to come first before the mains, but everything came at the same time.  We kept looking around for a waiter to ask for an extra plate to share the salad, but could never find anyone, so eventually we piled our dirty dishes in the middle of the table and split the salad ourselves.  Because of diabetes, I had asked for no bread crumbs on the salad, but the salad came with bread crumbs all over it anyway.  I didn't realize this until several minutes later.  The next day my blood sugar was the highest it has ever been.\\nRead more\",\n",

Two apps: One was a salad that amounted two a large heap of (way too much) cold butternut squash piled on burrata; the other was a warm ricotta cheese dish with focaccia bread. The apps were disproportionately large. Entirely too much squash on the \"salad\" and it was very cold. The ricotta dish has potential to be really good, but again too much cheese for one person. Really you just shouldn\\'t serve that much cheese to one person. Two entrees: Shortribs with grits and Guanciale carbonara. The shortrib dish was excellent. The carbonara was much like eating roasted minced garlic by the spoonful; pasta was done well but way way too much garlic. And I like garlic. Two desserts: cookies and the house special donuts. Cookies were delicious. The donuts were a complete disaster. Server came out to tell us that they were having problems with making the donuts and that it would only be a few more minutes (after 15 minutes already). We ended up getting them to go, and when we got home we looked at them and they were obviously inedible: Completely charred black and essentially raw dough on the inside. Very embarrassing for them. Servers are fantastic. Wine list is exceptional. Decor is very nice for New Haven.

However, it was part of a hotel and a fire alarm was set off requiring us to depart the dining room waiting 15 minutes for the Fire Department to arrive to disarm the system which continued to blurt loud sounds. Shame on the Fire Department for taking that long. After their departure, a new firm alarm went off and this time it took 20 minutes for the Fire Department to return, the entire time with customers suffering the loud alarm. The restaurant offered a 10% discount, which was, in my opinion, inadequate compensation for the inconvenience.

Heirloom has managed to maintain it's attentive wait  staff and they are all fun and excellent, without a hint of stuffiness or pretentiousness. Makes eating here a dream.  And as always, chef never disappoints.  Certainly our New Haven favorite.\\nRead more\",\n",

It had been a while since we\\'d visited Heirloom, we live on the east side of town, we rarely get to the West Chapel St. neighborhood.\\n\\nBriefly, the service has become a bit more predictable and professional.  It was fine before but we noticed a bit more polish this visit.  The food and wine list continues to be luscious for a early fall evening.  The Bouillabaisse  was fabulous, as remembered.  The Short Ribs were \"best-in-class\".  I don\\'t even like short ribs but the server\\'s description (given I was in the mood for meat) made me willing to try.  They were DELICIOUS.  Perfect.  The table shared a Caesar Salad, which had some nice twists and was big enough for four.  So. Great to remember why we loved this New Haven gem.  If you have reason to be at The Study or around West Chapel or just want good food in an upscale, urban setting, Heirloom fills the bill.\\nRead more',\n",

However, those weren't my dishes so I was just tasting what my family ordered. I would not order the wedge salad again (too much red onion and the serving size is huge- it's not a traditional wedge, it's cut up and all mixed together. The dressing was not great). The ribeye steak had no seasoning (agreed by the whole table) and was under cooked. I requested medium and it was medium rare/rare in some parts but I suppose because it was bone in, it's harder to cook that way. The service was okay, just the bare minimum to take our order and deliver food. No recommendations, no water refills, or offers to bring a second glass of wine. They were very busy and it was hard to get a check at the end of the meal. Overall, I was disappointed because I set the bar high for this restaurant.

My friend had the chicken cutlet dish topped with a savory warm blend of watercress, herbs and shaved Parmesan. I'm usually not a fan of cutlets, but the crust here was expertly done (and was gluten-free by using rice flour). My salmon dish was topped with a spring blend of sprouts and sat in a vegetable mash.

Husband ordered Niçoise salad with chicken; it arrived with salmon. Once replaced with chicken, he enjoyed the salad, but thought the dressing could have had more flavor. I ordered fish and chips: arrived cold. Soggy breading and cold soggy fries with a tablespoon sized coleslaw (which was not cold and crisp) was not good...at all. Daughter's waffle arrived so cold the butter didn't melt. And who would expect anything but a fluffy Belgian style waffle at this type of establishment? This was flatter than frozen Eggo's.

       "  \"We took our college age son and my mother for brunch. There is a very good selection and everyone found more than 1 thing they would like to order. The service was good and the waitress was very courteous to my mom, who is elderly and had numerous questions about the menu. The food- well there were some problems. The burrata starter was excellent but it kind went down hill after that.  The soups were under-seasoned. The fries were cold and would have been delicious had they been served hot. I had the kale frittata and it was really boring.  My husband's rueben was good but the corned beef was very fatty.  I think sticking to the bagels & such might have been a better idea.  However, the desserts were fantastic. The cheesecake & apple cider donuts were amazing. \\nThe dining room is lovely and it tickled me that they were playing Funny Girl on the TV. We didn't have any drinks outside of tea & coffee, which were very good.  \\nI would like to say I'd try it again but with so much to choose from in New Haven, I'm not sure I'll make it back.\\nRead more\",\n",

The menu is seafood-heavy, although there are enough options to avoid it if you don't like seafood. Dishes are decently portioned, well-presented, and very strongly flavored - every one is different! The charred broccoli with maple, miso and white soy was intensely sweet and savory. The scallop entree features three plump, succulent scallops on a healthy bed of spaghetti squash. The kale salad was topped with an unreal sour cherry vinaigrette. It's very wood-toned and dim in the dining room but with a lively noise level. Overall just a really nice spot.\\nRead more\",\n",

When we moved to our table the waiter was friendly and realized we were going to take a while as we were chatting and catching up.  He was accommodating.  The bread and horseradish spread was wonderful and the food that came out was lovely as well. The burger looked perfect, I had the clam risotto, which was over salted, but tasty and well cooked.   We also shared the lamb sausage pappardelle which had delicious, spicy flavor, and finally the scallops on spaghetti squash which was also delicious but over-salted. We were stuffed. So, we ordered dessert!!!  The coffee was perfection and we shared the homemade cookies with a ramekin of warm buttercream frosting.  The cookies were amazing- the frosting sweet and creamy, but we all felt it was a cream cheese and not buttercream flavor.  Good nonetheless.  No cookie crumbs left on our plates (frosting remained virtually untouched).  I'd go back again without question and would love to try brunch next time.

       "  \"We have dined at Heirloom about five times in the past and were a little concerned about some reviews that suggested the quality has slacked off. We had a table of five and everyone ordered something different and everyone was happy with their choices. The price was reasonable (albeit not cheap) considering the quality of the food, the attentive but inobtrusive service, and the pleasant ambiance. The only criticism we had was the dish that was billed as Bouillabaisse but was actually more like a Thai curry! It still tasted good but it definitely was not the famous French dish. It's things like that that keep this from being a five star but I think it rates four stars. I still think that Heirloom and Union League are the two best restaurants in New Haven.\\n\\nWe were also tickled to see Steve Martin on the way out ... he was headed off to see a production of his play ‘Picasso at the Lapin Agile’ at Long Wharf (where we were headed as well) and he graced the audience with some reflections during the talk-back after the show. Overall it was a special evening!\\nRead more\",\n",
