Paul,"Dined on November 17, 2024","My friend ordered the scallops which were $35 with no sides.  He received 3 scallops.  Were these scallops worth $12 a piece.  No, they were overcooked and rubbery.  We should've known that we were there at 7PM on a Saturday night and the place was virtually empty.  Never again",2 stars,Overall 2,Food 3,Service 4,Ambience 4
Paula,"Dined on November 15, 2024","It was a good experience. My server, a Latina who has been there several years, was outstanding. She has a way of appearing at just the right moment with a suggestion or choices that always suited us well.

But the food was only okay, not up to Heirloom’s high standards, despite the enticing descriptions. The half roasted chicken was a little too dry in the breast and the Delicata squash that accompanied it was so overcooked, it almost disintegrated among the spätzle. But the Caesar salad was great, with plenty of anchovies even though the kitchen split the dish before serving it to us.

Bettina,"Dined on November 10, 2024","We went for brunch.  The food was delicious.  The bagel and gravlox, bacon and egg sandwich, and ricotta pancakes with blueberries were scrumptious.  The service was friendly and professional.  It was 11am and closed the blinds.  This was a little wierd given the beautiful weather, and they never refilled our water bottle, but these are little things and we never actually asked them to refill the water.  This is a great place for a family meal, meet up with friends

HEIDI,"Dined on October 19, 2024","The food was really good. My colleague really loved his pork chop. The Caesar salad was big and fresh. The clam chowder, so-so. I guess I had high expectations for New England clam chowder since the restaurant is in New Haven, Connecticut. The only reason I’m not rating it 5 stars is because when the server asked if we wanted still or sparkling water, there was no mention that the still water would come in a bottle and cost 9 dollars.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 22, 2024","Dined for breakfast on a weekday, just as the restaurant opened. Although a few cuts of bacon served were cooked unevenly, delicious. The assorted fruit & pancakes were nothing extraordinary, and requested orange juice was forgotten by a team member until requested again to a separate team member. Dining experience could be considered as a standard menu with moderate tastes.

CareyB,"Dined on May 6, 2024","Heirloom has a wonderful array of food offerings. They also have a great mixologist, offering interesting cocktails like the Blackberry Bramble. It’s a great place for brunch - the salads, eggs with charred tomatoes, even a simple breakfast such as scrambled eggs with bacon and home fries. For me, it’s the welcome I always receive upon arrival. So inviting to be welcomed so warmly. I am a frequent visitor!

KarinaJ,"Dined on April 8, 2024","We enjoyed a kale salad with salmon (delicious) and a Caesar salad with chicken.  Can't give 5 stars for the the food because the chicken on the Caesar salad was ON THE BONE.  Why would you put chicken on the bone in a salad?  We expected a boneless breast--that's standard--and nothing on the menu indicated it would be on the bone--making it very difficult to cut and enjoy.  The waiter was very meek and soft spoken and barely interacted with us.  Flavors were very good and atmosphere was good.  They put the bottle of water on the table which was a nice touch so we could refill on our own.

SamS,"Dined on February 4, 2024","We were very impressed from the internet to find this breakfast and brunch place. Pictures look great. Made a reservation for 11:15.  We had to wait around 10 min to be seated.   Table was not as cleaned and salt and paper was all over the table.  Staffing was not as friendly and they were just working.  No Ketchup was provided with Berger and sandwich and had to wait for awhile.  My Cesar Salad with roasted chicken was not what I thought it was going to be.  Chicken was very dried and was not as moist.  Maybe about 5 white anchovies were  laying on the top of salad and the salad was soggy.  My daughter was happy with Berger but fries were all dried and looks like it may have been last basket of fries (all broken).  Definitely we will go back.  Sam from NJ

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 25, 2023","Our main dishes took over an hour and a half to come out after ordering (we were there for almost 3 hours), everyone else in the restaurant who got sat after us got their food before us, and when my dish came out (scallops and mushrooms) the mushrooms were cold. After asking the waiter if there was something else they could make quickly since my meal was cold, he suggested I could order a salad.
Instead, they offered to reheat and replate the dish, but in doing so they overcooked the scallops.

It would be understandable if they were really busy, but they weren’t. I think the waiter forgot to put in our order and made excuses that the kitchen was really backed up, but everyone else got their food before us.

The roasted carrots were bland and the chicken overcooked that my husband ordered.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 28, 2023","Went there for a lunch out with my husband. Got the burrata and prosciutto and truffle ricotta which was great. Also loved my drink. I thought ""can't go wrong with a burger"". I was wrong. We both ordered the grass fed burger, he ordered it medium rare and I got mine medium well. His was STRAIGHT UP RAW and not even warm. He loves a rare burger and this was still too raw for him. Mine was very rare and slightly warm. The meal had potential if it was cooked. We waited for our waitress to come back to see if they can cook it more. We waited and waited. We ate part of one of the halves. By the time she came we were on on the verge of nausea because it was so slimy and mushy. Sorry for the description. She asked if we wanted to wait and get a new burger but we were doing a meet and greet for a concert and had to leave. I feel she should've given it for half the price or comped it. For a $22 burger, and a higher end restaurant, I would hold it to a higher standard. My husband is stomach sick today. Kinda disappointed because I heard good things but won't be going back.

Jill,"Dined on November 24, 2023","Thanksgiving dinner.... We were excited to eat out, but this experience was one epic fail after another.  Where to begin?  40 minutes to get a canned beer?  Salad dressing that was almost a solid?  Waiting 15 minutes for utensils with the main getting cold in front of us? So cold, couldn't eat it.  Two salads with dressing on the side for Thanksgiving dinner?  Begging for the check so we could leave?  My dinner and a salad were comped.  My husband just ate his cold, because he was starving.  Maybe it was our server, maybe it was the holiday, but they weren't overwhelmingly busy.... The other servers were fairly helpful to us.  I don't know, but we will definitely remember this Thanksgiving.

Breakfast is good, basic fare, although the coffee is not at the quality level of the food and often not hot enough.  It is recommended to get a better quality blend of stronger coffee and consider offering french press. 

The major issue is a decline in service. While not an issue in the past, the wait staff is currently poorly trained, inattentive, forget to bring items requested, and lack a sense of urgency to get food to the table. The wait times have been too long to get food and the bill. This detracts from a lovely ambiance and very good food.

ConstanceC,"Dined on September 18, 2023","We started with the mushroom toast, which was not great.  The bread was difficult to chew, the flavor was just ok. My partner had the Bison and I had the scallops. Both were waaay over salted. We managed to eat the bison because we were hungry,  but the scallops (despite being *cooked* perfectly) were so salty we couldn't eat them. 
The service was very slow and the place was very loud.  They need to put rugs down to fix the acoustics.  
We will not be returning.

Dishes we previously loved are listed the same on the menu but are executed completely differently. The carrots were not the nice multicolored ones, caramelized and served with the sauce but rather sliced steamed orange ones floating in the steamer water. The crispy potatoes were steamed potatoes and we had to ask twice for the sauce they were supposed to be served with, and the scallops were flavorless. So disappointed.

BillClay,"Dined on July 9, 2023","We enjoyed our dinner at Heirloom - it was quite good but a bit short of ""excellent"" or ""outstanding"".  The blueberry bramble cocktail I had was a real treat! It was followed by the mushroom toast appetizer. I liked it but felt it was missing a zing to get the otherwise mild flavor to pop. My beef cheek bourginonne was excellent, although it arrived at the table a bit tepid - I suspect it was waiting around while my wife's sirloin was getting overcooked. We asked that they take it back and try again, which they did without hesitation (and they got it right the second time). We split the apple donut dessert, which we thought was spectacular... nice and crispy outside, fluffy and light inside, with a sweet sauce on the side that complemented them perfectly. It was not very busy so the background noise level was quite low. I forget how much I enjoy going out in New Haven when the hubbub of Yale dies down in the summer...

The Heirloom Burger - a personal favorite - was nicely prepared but the cheddar was not melted and the brioche bun fell apart after the first bite. This may be start-up strain and we'll be back, but this evening was disappointing.

Our reservations were at 7:15. We got our appetizer at 8:15. One hour later! 
The corn appetizer was so salty, that we asked for bread. Multiple times. It never came. Main course (pasta) was bland. All in all a very disappointing dining experience.

Wine and appetizer served promptly, but we had a 40-minute wait for our dinner entrees. Crowd chatter made it difficult for two of us to converse across our table. Limited number of waitstaff.

My meal came at least 10 minutes after my patty’s. Our waiter disappeared and we had empty glasses for 10 minutes before we saw him. I asked a food runner for a drink. There was hardly any customers there. Someone could have helped is our server was busy.  Our bill came…. 120 something, and my mom forgot to order coffee.  She ordered a cup of decaf and instead of letting it go… he added it to the bill. After a wrong order, slow service, a comped cup of coffee would have been a decent jester.

LynneG,"Dined on June 18, 2022","We are actually regulars that go out every Friday night and have a rotation of New Haven restaurants that we go to. This restaurant has always been in this rotation. WOW last night they dropped the ball! I could barely break into the falafel and sat there for a half an hour waiting for the waiter to come by to ask how things were or if we wanted more drinks. I had to have another waiter go find our waiter, who was not apologetic at all. He then proceeded to have someone else wait on us the rest of the night. It was disappointing that the manager did not come out. I felt like it was a waste of a night out and not sure that we will be back. We actually went to another restaurant for dessert and drinks after leaving this restaurant were I actually wrote this review.  It’s sad as I’ve actually recommended this restaurant multiple times. I did reach out through email with this same review but with no response.

Court,"Dined on May 1, 2022","I have been to this restaurant over 20 times in the last 10 years and it is always consistent when I go but sadly it always falls apart when I bring others with me. For my birthday celebration, there were 4 of us. 

Great drinks and good food. I adore the kales salad and the salmon was cooked perfectly and all our appetizers were great. They had “run out of the burger” because of demand at brunch. Normally, it would not be a huge deal but with such a limited menu after being closed for years with COVID, this left my guest with very few options to choose from. We rebounded though and everything else we ordered was excellent.

The service we never rebounded from. Our server seemed sidetracked and unengaged and seemed to want to be anywhere but there. So this made for a long 2 hours and at at an upscale place, it has fallen off my go to list for special occasions. 

I look forward to Heirloom returning to more consistent service so I can share it with friends confidently.

A minor modification (pea pesto on the side due to an allergy) was not done so the rice accompaniment was not edible as it was swimming in pea pesto.

For $26 dollars I was shocked that the lamb ragu was smaller than my appetizer; I know the meat can be pricey but there could have been more noodles. 

The caeser salad with anchovies was bland and the blood orange salad was all raddichio and no dressing so that made for a bitter experience. 

The best part of the night was the appetizer but warmed ricotta and bread is hard to ruin.

mrgastronomie,"Dined on January 16, 2022","I’ve had brunch at Heirloom many times before and was never disappointed, but last night’s dinner left much to be desired. While the restaurant was fairly empty, service was slow and inattentive. Our food took a long time to arrive, and once it did arrive, the reason was clear. It had been sitting around waiting for our server to bring it to us. Thus, my medium rare steak was now a slightly chilled medium with a side of room temperature vegetables. I sent it back and the server graciously took it away without making a fuss. If the restaurant were busy or understaffed, it would have been more understandable, but there wasn’t any clear reason for the poor service. We’ll be returning for brunch, and I’m hoping last night was just an anomaly. As I’ve mentioned, I’ve always had a great experience at Heirloom, so hopefully it was just an off night.

We just went back for the first time since they re opened, and I have to say, I’m heartbroken. 
We waited over an hour for our food. And not once did someone come check in with us during that time. Yes, the food was okay. But it wasn’t anything I couldn’t get somewhere else in new haven now.

I can tell they’re understaffed. Maybe time for management to reevaluate if they want this business to succeed. I for sure won’t be recommending anyone to go there. I truly hope they turn things around.

When they brought my dish back out it was warm on one side and cold on the other.  It seemed like it was microwaved.  Other than that experience with my dish, my husband’s entree was good and the drinks were ok.

JackieL,"Dined on August 7, 2021","It seems from the ambiance that this once was a good restaurant that was maybe impacted by the current world situation but it was such an aggressive let down I am really
Upset it cost so much we feel swindled. Went there to celebrate a birthday for the “farm to table” aspect of it, and for the prices we expected food to be well prepared with good ingredients at the very least which it wasn’t.

 Received stale, unsalted, “heirloom” French fries with ketchup and baked ricotta with toasted stale bread for the apps which we should have just left after that but the description of main menu items looked more promising?? 

A $36 fatty steak wasn’t hot enough to melt the butter on top Served with burnt, charcoaled broccoli that was the “seasonal vegetable” which was then replaced with unseasoned steamed to actively disintegrating broccoli. 

Crab pasta did not come as described on menu cheap substitutions real bummer and didn’t taste like much. 

Maybe 4 other tables occupied but service was dragging so, they brought out another baked ricotta on the house and we asked if it was bc the food was so slow coming out?? “No, no, just cause” 
Only one person finished their meals, we were offered dessert on the house because they, “felt bad” and we honestly didn’t want to be there or eat anything else there and just wanted to pay and leave. It was a very awkward experience and we were really bummed that we wasted money there.

The space is lovely, the service is good, the menu choices are excellent, and the value for this level of quality is outstanding. Our recent Sunday brunch was no exception. Our party of 4 was engaged in conversation and the waitperson was respectful until we signaled we could order. She was prompt and efficient. Our food was great. The Carmel Apple Doughnut appetizer was a total home run. Crazy tasty! Three of the four had Benedict options and each was enthusiastic about the food. The fresh biscuit instead of an English muffin was great. My burger was prepared perfectly to order. The cost for four without alcohol was a very reasonable $107 (without tip) for an excellent dining experience. The only downside was not being offered dessert. We were presented with the check before asking which we took as a signal we overstayed our welcome. That was uncharacteristic for me and not a good impression. Still, overall, an outstanding experience and we'll be back.

Supper was alright, service was slow (as it was the last time I went in for breakfast). Bouillabaisse was good, but Shell & Bones has a bouillabaisse that’s a bit better. Kale salad with “sour” cherry vinaigrette was pretty sweet and the sweetness built with each bite. Definitely wouldn’t have ordered if I realized how sweet it was. Didn’t even look at the dessert menu because I was afraid if a kale salad was moderately sugary and sweet that an actual dessert would be unbearably saccharine.

The restaurant is not up to serving people on time.  We were there on Tuesday at 5:30 pm and we were the fourth table to be seated.   We ordered promptly and the waiter told us that dinner will take at least 30 minutes because one of us ordered a well done burger and that takes longer.  That was fine with us.  Our entrees finally showed up almost one hour later and we noticed that no one at the other tables had their entree yet - salads were out, as was a sandwich at one table, but not hot entrees.

I had scallops which were ok but the chef had a heavy hand with the salt, they were too salty.  My dining partner had a grass fed burger and did not like the taste of the meet.  The fries which came with the burger were also too salty.

She had the scallops they were ok no much good flavors from the spaghetti squash I don’t think it goes well with the scallops oh well but my lamb ragú was amazing best thing I had in a while . 
The ambiance was not good at all we were celebrating valentine day and no decor no romantic music no free drink it could be nice little more romance in the air.

My brunch companion loved his banana french toast and I had some. It was tasty. But my smoked salmon benedict was all cold except for the eggs. One of the eggs was poached perfectly, the other, the yolk was entirely cooked through. The hollandaise was too lemony, too yolky- fine, but a little different from what I expected, and again, cold. Not lukewarm. Cold. And I get that they're proud of their biscuits. I do. But a benedict doesn't belong on anything with a cake-like texture. It just crumbled and made the whole thing mealy, while the biscuit itself got soggy. Also, my companion ordered tea, was asked four different questions about how he would like it, and it never came.

ISPEAKFORERIN,"Dined on February 8, 2020","The best duck I've been served (med-rare as requested), on Friday, February 7. 
Truly delicious and much appreciated!  Hats off to the chef.  (SEARED LIBERTY DUCK BREAST, Braised Leeks, Swiss Chard [was served kale, which I like better anyway], Turnips, Carrots, Sunchoke Puree & Lavender Honey Jus | gf).  

My love was not as excited about his burger - described as  ""OK"".  Patty was overcooked, but the fries were seriously perfection! (CT GRASS-FED BEEF BURGER, Grafton Cheddar, Horseradish Jam, Our Pickles, Shoestring Fries *Our 100% Grass-fed Local Beef Is Raised & Ground For Us By Our Friends At Four Mile River Farm In Old Lyme, Connecticut.)

We had a special appetizer of shishito peppers and rice balls with a horseradish dipping sauce that was a delicious combination and not too heavy (for fried rice balls, very light).  Although the bartender described it as ""kind of a reverse popper"", it was definitely up several levels from that and much more interesting for the palate.  Very tasty.  I wish there was a simple greens salad on the menu (healthy, light), which would have made a nice combo to start.  

We had IPAs at the bar, but very nice bartender also served us a complimentary gin drink with rosemary that was quite delicious. 

Would come here again for the food in a heartbeat.  Looking forward to trying the Bouillabaisse (Heirloom Fish Stew' Shrimp, Mussels & White Fish In Saffron Lobster Sherry-Bisque-Broth With Cilantro, Lime & Aioli).  MMmmm!!!  :)

Then my medium steak came out literally bloody, I sent it back but you can’t re-cook a steak that was already cut into, so I ate what I could and  I wrapped up my leftovers and brought them home for my dogs, they didn’t mind rare, re-cooked meat. 

I had listed a special occasion on Open Table for my wife’s birthday and to have a birthday dessert but that never happened... they were gracious enough to take the steak off of the tab.

Even though we were among the first in the restaurant, it took our waiter 15 minutes to get us a drink and an hour to circle back to the table to take our dinner order.  We finally received our food at 7 pm by which point we had observed several other tables (much larger parties) receive their dinner orders.  Having been a wait person myself, I know the difference between being slammed and inattentive, poor service.  Even if the slow service was due to a back up in the kitchen, the waitress should have checked in with us to let us know that the kitchen was backed up (although not likely given we arrived for a 5:30 reservation).  The food was ok - not as good as I would have expected for farm-to table.  I had scallops which were way over-salted.

My husband and I were staying at The Study for our 28th anniversary and decided to have dinner downstairs at Heirloom.  Big mistake.  The evening started out promisingly, with decent martinis and a delicious chicken liver pâté.  And then we waited for our main course. And waited. And waited. And waited.  At least 30 minutes with no acknowledgement of the delay.  After the waitress had finally come by to tell us it would be “a couple more minutes,” and many many many more minutes had passed after that, with other servers offering to check, we finally got our meal... with no apology.  Our only offer of compensation was an espresso on the house, which we declined. At that point we only wanted to get out of there.  And we will most certainly never be back.

SueandJim,"Dined on November 5, 2019","My friend and I met there for an early lunch on a slower day, despite it being NH Restaurant week. We both ordered Tuna Melt Sandwiches- she with a side of fries and me a side salad. Strangely, my sandwich and salad arrived along with her french fries but NO sandwich for her. Hmmmm? A bus boy delivered the food, and our waitress was not around. She finally checked in about half way through my sandwich and promised to ask in the kitchen, and acted like this wasn't a problem. About 15 minutes later, her sandwich arrived. No apologies, just an extra side salad, which my friend didn't really want t this point. I have to say, the sandwiches were huge, but not really a traditional grilled melt. The cheese was melted, but it was so thick it was really messy and the tuna was cold. I ate mine with a fork. The salad was drenched in a tart lemony vinaigrette dressing. I have dined there before and it was good but they were off their game this time. With so many great restaurants in NH, I don't know if I'd return.

The only issue was it took a very long time to get our food.  I don’t know if there were kitchen issues that night but we were there for over 2 hours and weren’t drinking.  Our orders were pretty simple. Yet the food took forever, to the point where the server acknowledged the fact and they offered us free dessert which we accepted and then regretted b/c then the dessert took over 20 mins to come out! 
So I’m not sure how to rate Heirloom.  Food was good (when we got it), servers were great, ambience also great.  So if you don’t mind waiting for your food this is a wonderful place. Reasonable prices, good food.  Slow kitchen

LandArchitect,"Dined on September 5, 2019","We went for a birthday celebration. The restaurant was busy, but definitely not slammed. Several tables where open, and there seemed to be enough staff. Although our server was very friendly, she was hard to find when we needed her. We ordered drinks and apps. We wanted to wait till the apps arrived , then order dinner. But the apps took so long the waitress came several times to take our order. 
The cheese sampler was very good with a wonderful honey comb on the side, and the smoked trout amazing. However the smoked trout was a good sized serving, but it was served with three slices of bread- weird. I guess we could have made sandwiches!
Dinner took about 30 minutes plus to arrive after that. The Shrimp dish pasta was extremely undercooked. Thought the shrimp were good I was told, both who ordered it only ate the shrimp. The scallops were superb. The gnocchi was very good, though there was a very faint taste of flour. 

As the whole meal took such a long time we decided against the dessert.

The concept is great and the potential there- but it was just so off I will not go again.

Their menu is very interesting and offers wonderful combinations.  The appetizers were very flavorful.  I had salmon which was cooked perfectly and had a great combination of vegetables and rice.  The salmon  was a little on the bland side though.  My husband had steak.  He was a bit disappointed because it was fatty but he is very picky.  Not all places specialize in steaks so I feel based on past reviews Heirloom is definitely worth trying.  I wouldn't order the steak though.

My crudite with hummus was a bowl of vegetables--so if you favored one vegetable in particular, you'd have to search for it-- with a practically inedible hummus (The main spices seemed to have been chili pepper and paprika) My duck breast was tough and the vegetables fairly tasteless. My husband's martini was, in his words, below par and so was his fish dish. I think the food was so mediocre, I would not even go to the restaurant again to give it a second chance.  And seriously, when I order DRY sherry, I don't expect the wait person to bring me what I am pretty sure was very sweet port with a cherry draped over the edge of the glass.

Finally our server came over and apologized for the delay, but just said the kitchen was backed up. No drinks or snacks on the house while waiting, no discount on the check, just an apology after all that time. We then waited another 20 minutes for food that was okay but not extraordinary.

411Mul,"Dined on April 5, 2019","The food was very good but the service was terrible. After we sat down, our server came by to take our drink order. We told her we had 90 minutes before we had to leave for the symphony. She did not return for 20-30 minutes to take our food order. We skipped appetizers as we were running short of time. Thirdly minutes later our food arrived. After eating our main course we asked to have our waiter bring the desert menus. She eventually brought the menus and we ordered desert on the spot. However, we had to leave before the desert arrived. Maybe if people have two or three hours to dine, Heirloom would be a fine place but expect to be ignored by the waitstaff.

chrisfromtexas,"Dined on April 3, 2019","The food is almost always excellent at this hotel-connected restaurant, but the service is very erratic, and it's hard to tell if it is the fault of some of the servers, or the kitchen, or some other coordinating layer.  The servers are unfailingly polite, but about every third time I visit the restaurant something goes very wrong with the timing of the service. This last time, our party ordered cocktails, and since we had also decided on our food, we ordered it at the same time.  Our starters arrived about 10 minutes after we ordered, then our cocktails arrived about 5 minutes later - not the way one expects a gracious and relaxing dinner to go.  Our main courses arrived at least 1 hour after our starters, which we had finished 45 minutes earlier.  In the meantime, we were given another complimentary starter to share, and at the end of the meal (when two of us had to leave due to the hour) we were brought a medley of complimentary desserts.  We appreciated the effort to ""make it up to us,"" but bringing additional food that diners did not order and may not want is no substitute for delivering on what is expected in the first place.  These lapses may be due to the kitchen being overwhelmed by private dinners elsewhere in the hotel (the dining room has never been very full when they occur), but the restaurant needs to figure out a way to deal with whatever so often causes this problem.

It’s a good size dining room, so you’re not on top of other diners & a very comfortable space. I went this time w/ my 96 year old mother & found it easy to maneuver w/ her & her walker. There are a few steps to get into the lobby, but she holds onto the rail & I carry the walker. Also, since parking is not always easy in downtown New Haven, this is a breeze, since they have a valet. Totally recommend Heirloom!

SusanS,"Dined on March 17, 2019","This was an Anniversary Meal, and we expected to be ""Wow-ed"".  We were not. First, we were seated at a table that rocked, significantly.  We asked to be moved, and the waiter appeared to panic. He rushed off, to consult, even though there were two other tables open right next to us. We were moved to a new table, but I observed our salads get ""lost"" when an assistant came out with them, didn't see us at the expected table, and disappeared, only to have the Manager bring them out a few minutes later. Two other couples sat at that rocking table during our stay.
Food was generally good, my wife was unable to eat more than a few bites of her salad, as the dressing was unfathomably spicey, and had not been noted that way in the menu. Also, she ordered 6 oysters, and was served 3, which turned out to be fine, but still...
Protein portions were good, but the advertised accompaniments were tiny - like a tablespoon of squash, and three small mushrooms.
Early on, we indicated we were in no rush, when asked if we had theater plans.  Service was OK, but not very attentive throughout the meal.  However, when it came time to order and receive dessert - the wait was interminable. Mine was premade with a scoop of icecream on top, and my wife's was 3 fried donut balls. Nothing elaborate that would justify the wait.
Overall, not sure this was worth the cost. We don't mind an expensive meal for a special occasion, but we would like it to actually be special.

The seating does not give you a personal feel, having bench seats down the wall and sitting couples on a romantic evening right next to eachother with a sparsely seated dining room.  Food selection was heavy on seafood with the only steak option a $36 dry aged steak, which was just ok on flavor.  Wine selection was outstanding and the server had a very good knowledge of the wines.  For a $155 food and wine bill (1 bottle @ 60), I believe there are much nicer restaurants out there.

Nikki,"Dined on January 15, 2019","The food was average and the price was what you would expect from a hotel restaurant.  $15 - $25.00 a plate for lunch.  I ordered Grilled cheese w/fires, my husband go the burger w/tomato soup and we ordered a spinach and artichoke dip appetizer along with two sodas.  The total was about $54.00 

The service was extremely slow with no waitstaff even on the floor should you need something.  We were immediately seated and our drinks taken. Then about 5 - 10 min later we placed our orders.  It took slightly longer then normal to receive our food but we were ok with that.  However after we received our food we did not see anyone again.  No one checked in to see how things were or if we needed anything else.  We waited a good 25 minutes after finishing our lunch before even getting the attention of someone.  All we wanted was to wrap the left overs & get the check.  The table next to us who was there before us was also waiting for their check.  They were ready to just walk out at one point.  

It was not busy maybe 6 - 10 tables with about 4 staff members working who all just hung out in the coffee bar area chatting.  We were looking around for anyone grab our waiters attention but as we looked around there was not one waitstaff member on the floor walking around.  It was not until my husband started staring over at the coffee bar someone finally came over and asked if we needed something. 

I would say the overall experience was less the expected.  The restaurant is located in the Yale University district  located by tons of amazing restaurants within the same price range. From the info online and the location we expected more.  Based on the wait time and the food quality compared to price we would probably not visit again.   

On a positive side the restaurant it self is located in a nice are close to shopping, gallery, theaters and hotel.  The decor and space is very nice and may be great for a late night social for some cocktails and apps.

CTFoodies,"Dined on December 16, 2018","As usual, it was just the two of us and we were looking for some place new for dinner on a Saturday night. I went to Open Table to see where I could make a reservation in New Haven. The first place that popped up was Heirloom, the restaurant located in The Study in the Yale Hotel. Even though I was born and raised in New Haven, I knew little about the restaurant. When we entered the restaurant, we were impressed by its look and feel. We were seated quickly and presented with menus and water. We ordered specialty cocktails, a Paper Plane and a Moonshine Lemonade, that were both delicious and larger than other fine dining places. The bread was served with a horseradish mayonnaise spread that was fantastic. For appetizers we ordered the Baked Clams and the Roasted Oysters which were on a nice, spicy ragu. They arrived at our table hot, which I love, They were both fabulous. For entrees we ordered the Fried Clam Risotto and the Baked Chicken. We also ordered a very nice Williamette Valley Pinot Noir. We also ordered the Sweet and Sour Broccoli that came with a great Mable and White Soy Sauce. Again they were right from the oven and fabulous. Alexander, our fabulous waiter, also gave us a taste of a great Spanish wine whose name escapes me. As usual, I had to have dessert and coffee. I ordered the Pana Cotta and it was perfect. With the very good, food, service and ambiance, we will certainly be back.

305E40thStreet4J,"Dined on December 16, 2018","We get together with friends from Fairfield (CT) just before Christmas every year in New Haven, which is halfway from our home in Cromwell. It was my first time at Heirloom, although my husband has had Yale-related business luncheons there and has spoken favorably about the venue. The validated valet parking was a plus, as street parking in downtown New Haven can often be tricky; at the conclusion of the meal, we gave the ticket to the server and our car was waiting for us as we exited the building. Our OpenTable reservation was immediately honored and we were seated at an attractive table for four. My only complaint here is that the restaurant is very dark -- on a winter evening, it was hard to read the menu and pay the check at the conclusion of the meal. My husband had as an appetizer the wedge salad, which he quite enjoyed; I had four shrimp, which I didn't much care for -- they didn't have the steakhouse flavor (e.g., Morton's) that I prefer. My husband had the steak and mashed potatoes, which he liked; I had the gnocchi, as did one of our friends, and we liked the subtle flavor and the portion size; the fourth member of our party had the salmon, which he seemed to enjoy -- there was certainly nothing left on his plate. The bread was quite crusty/chewy, which is always a plus. We didn't have coffee or dessert. All in all, it was a very good meal. The acid test: would I go back? Yes, we have already made plans to meet again there on December 14, 2019, for our annual pre-holiday dinner. [We were in a bit of a hurry, so the server discouraged us from getting the chicken, which she said could take 35 - 45 to prepare, which seemed somewhat extraordinary, but we appreciated the heads up.]

Had to send everything back and wait another 10-15 minutes for dishes. They were very apologetic and I would still go back, but that was not a restaurant I would expect that to happen at.

The waiter was kind and friendly, and it was cool to go to a place that was seasonal/local. The best Kale salad I have ever had was here! The entree was delicious although a bit on the smaller side, and I really enjoyed my wine. However, the dessert was just WAY to sweet for myself and the two people I was with and pushed us over the edge in a not so great way.  We couldn't finish them! (The Meyer lemon and salted carmel buttscotch panna cotta). However the rest of the meal was great so I would definitely go back!

It had been a while since we've been there, and happy to see some new dishes on the menu.

After sharing the pumpkin burrata, I had the duck and my wife the red snapper, both exquisite.
Our server was extremely helpful with wine suggestions and managing our time so they were unrushed but finished before curtain rise at the Rep.

Heirloom is great combo of top-shelf food and relaxed atmosphere.

2. I was looking for a spicy cocktail. I asked what is Pisco?  Waiter said no spicy cocktails, and had no idea what genre of alcohol Pisco is. He went to bartender and cane back with info that it’s a whisky. Still no spice. I chose the Pisco porton sour-. It was delicious. I’ve learned that Pisco is a brandy and it is hot & spicy.  Waiter should have known, or found out.

Possibly the worst risotto I've ever eaten. Correction, tried to eat. Dry, solid, stodge. Soooo amateur, so badly cooked, so ""couldn't care less"". Mercifully we had great company. A great place to meet friends and to be on a diet because you can order what you like and not want to eat it.

I went to Open Table to see where I could make a reservation in New Haven. The first place that popped up was Heirloom, the restaurant located in The Study in the Yale Hotel. Even though I was born and raised in New Haven, I knew little about the restaurant. When we entered the restaurant, we were impressed by its look and feel. We were seated quickly and presented with menus and water. We ordered specialty cocktails, a Paper Plane and a Moonshine Lemonade, that were both delicious and larger than other fine dining places. The bread was served with a horseradish mayonnaise spread that was fantastic. For appetizers we ordered the Baked Clams and the Roasted Oysters which were on a nice, spicy ragu. They arrived at our table hot, which I love, They were both fabulous. For entrees we ordered the Fried Clam Risotto and the Baked Chicken. We also ordered a very nice Williamette Valley Pinot Noir. We also ordered the Sweet and Sour Broccoli that came with a great Mable and White Soy Sauce. Again the were right from the oven and fabulous. Alexander, our fabulous waiter, also gave us a taste of a great Spanish wine whose name escapes me. As usual, I had to have dessert and coffee. I ordered the Pana Cotta and it was perfect. With the very good, food, service and ambiance, we will certainly be back.

He was informative about the menu, happy to steer us to those dishes he thought we'd enjoy (he was right) and made our dining experience that much more enjoyable. He is a credit to the restaurant. We would definitely recommend the place.

JodiM,"Dined on April 3, 2018","This is the second time we have been for a special occasion and neither time did they do anything special for us. 
The waitress wasn't very friendly at all..My husband had the Duck (well done) the first time and it was delicious so I ordered it the second time (well done) and it was tough and tasted very gamey, horrible. I could not eat it so I gave it to my husband who didn't like it either.. Very disappointing. For the price you pay it should be outstanding every time. We told the waitress when she finally came over, she certainly didn't seem to care, she gave us a coffee (which was cold), I asked for another which was better..
We have gone on a Monday night both times and it's very busy and noisy.
The reason we went back a second time was the first time was fantastic, and when it's a special occasion you want something that's above standard, unfortunately the second time was very disappointing so we won't be going back..

I got a call 6:58 from the restaurant asking if I was coming for my 7 pm reservation ( I was parking)- I thought get that was quite odd but now I wonder if they were really short staffed
If so, I wish they had just said so
It took 1 hr and 45 minutes to get our food
4 drinks were served— but not the fifth ( until we asked)
Service was shockingly inattentive 

There are many places in New Haven to eat
They will have to do better to stay alive

We arrived at 6pm and told our waiter we were going to the Yale Rep and needed to leave by 7:45pm.  We actually had to get up from our table to find our waiter to place our meal order! Each course took longer and longer. Our main course arrived at 7;30pm.    We were never offered dessert or coffee, and again had to flag the waiter down to get our bill.  The restaurant was half full on a Saturday night, so they were not extremely busy.  

I was told by one staff member, when I complained, that the management team was busy openning a restaurant in Philadelphia and all the good people had gone to Philly.  Uh oh..that does not sound good.  The food itself was great - just lousy service which ruined the meal.

I had a burger as it was the most appealing thing on the menu.  Good flavor.   Fries had good flavor too but were soggy.  Service was uninterested.

Even so, the food was good, but all of our meals were quite cold. I think I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and just say they were having an off service day.  We asked for coffee numerous times, but were only brought it after our fourth request, and nearly forty minutes after sitting down.  They likewise failed to adhere to any other requests that we made, even though they accepted them with a smile.  Again, I think it was an off-day for them, and I would consider giving them a second shot, but the service really was awful.

We had a great dinner in a beautiful restaurant.  Our waiter was very helpful and very attentive, but the food was slow coming out of the kitchen.  The Caesar salad was a hit and slightly unusual with endives and lots of white anchovies.  The acorn squash with burrata was a delicious combination.  The octopus was just too oily.  The lamb ragu was good - tons of delicious lamb, but the pasta may have been a little too doughy.  The stepped bass was a home run!  Great big thick piece of perfectly cooked and seasoned fish.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 17, 2017","As I walked into the restaurant, I felt good about my choice to bring my parents here for Sunday brunch. The place was busy, the menu looked enticing, and the trendy, contemporary appearance was clean and upscale. Unfortunately, things weren’t as smooth as I was expecting. Our waiter could barely be heard above the noise in the room. I don’t think he even tried to project and even the simple words came out like he had marbles in his mouth, as my mother would say. The menu over promised. My wife had a veggie burger that was over spiced and she couldn’t eat it. The French toast was okay but it had more cream than I would have preferred and not enough berries to give it the flavor to make it anything special.  

It’s a nice place but I left with the feeling that we must have had the “B-team” chef and waiters this Sunday. At least I hope that’s the case. Because it could be a great restaurant.

TonyS,"Dined on September 13, 2017","The Bread Had More Character - The appetizers were bland to bad, the baked Ricotta with herbs was baked cheese and the Roasted Octopus was swimming in oil and reminded me of the cooked octopus packed in oil you buy in a tin with the same fishy taste. The entrees were not much better, the Long Island Duck was gamey and tough. If it were seasoned properly it may have been better. The wild caught Stripped Bass appeared to be a tail piece and half of the filet was mostly brown fat when I lifted the skin, although it was cooked properly the mix with zucchini and asparagus had no flavor. The highlight of the meal was the whipped butter infused with grated horse radish served with the bread, but all and all the meal was a disappointment. If you are staying at the hotel, I would go across the street to the Florian the food is better, just slow service. I will cross this one off the list, there are plenty of good restaurants in New Haven  to meet your needs.

They strive for the farm to table concept, but I wish they would concentrate more on people who have food allergies and the wait staff isn't very familiar with what's in the food. They did ask, so that was nice. I'd like to give the server 5 stars but she had to be in a meeting during our meal, which was odd. But she was extremely nice. I also got an email from OpenTable where I made the reservation and the restaurant said I didn't honor my reservation. I had made a reservation for the evening and cancelled it. I made a subsequent reservation for 2:00 pm and showed up early, so I'm not sure what the issue was, but I didn't receive credit through OpenTable. That's not very nice and they should make sure they get this system right in the future.

The entrees were so good that it would be a challenge for even the best home gourmet cook to duplicate. There is nothing worse than going into a pricey restaurant and concluding that you could have made the same dish at home for a fraction of the price. But that is not the case here. Fresh ingredients, great Chef and nice table with a view of Chapel Street. Both times we have been here I would not hesitate to recommend.

The ambiance is terrific, as are the cocktails and wine list. We were celebrating our 6th wedding anniversary, and they treated us to a dessert flight that was just out of this world! It was such a nice touch. On another visit, the service was a little slow at times, and it seemed that perhaps they were understaffed a bit, but overall, we have had very pleasant experiences, and will definitely be returning!

My daughter was undecided over so many good options. She finally chose the Canadian bacon eggs benedict which she said was ""very good"". The decor was chic and the atmosphere was relaxing.

RachelT,"Dined on May 29, 2017","I have been to Heirloom four or five times. The last time I went was with a large group. We had to send the doughnuts back two times because they were not cooked. Each time they arrived, they appeared cooked on the outside, but were liquid batter on the inside. After taking them away the second time, the server came back to say that the cooks didn't make the fryer hot enough. No offer to get us another dessert, etc.

Flash forward to lunch today: I took my daughter out for what I thought would be a nice lunch. Our server was soooo bad that I thought I was on a hidden camera show. I could make this long, but here are four highlights--1. They were out of four lunch items on the menu. 2. The burger that I ordered medium came out with a blood saturated bun. I cut into burger and the inside was raw. She told me that is their medium (I have ordered this before and never had raw meat served as medium). I can handle a burger from medium rare to well, so if I can't eat it hen there's a problem. I asked her to have them throw it back on and it came back well. 3. I ordered an iced tea. She never refilled it or even offered to fill it in over an hour. I moved the glass to the far left on the table to make it super visible...with no luck. 4. We waited 25 minutes after we were finished eating before she brought out our check. 

I want to love this place. But, my bad experiences have outweighed my first couple of good ones.

Meal:  My wife ordered the soft shell crab and I ordered the Ribeye steak. My wife's meal was very bland with very little taste. My steak was cooked perfectly. 
Dessert: I ordered the butterscotch pudding. That was very good, but I had to ask our waiter twice for it.
Service: Below average. I had a glass of wine, the waiter actually filled it up with water. As I had mentioned before, had to wait forever for desert. 
Cost: If a meal is a four or five star, I never worry about the cost. It becomes something to experience. In this case, the meal did not justify the cost.

when we needed him but not hovering.   The food is...good. I wish I could say it's better than that but to be honest, (and I am not trying to make this about money) if you're charging top dollar for entrees (and they are) they better be perfect.  Everybody 'liked' their meals but there were no raves.  Commenting on mine in particular, the scallops on spaghetti squash, was an odd amalgam of ingredients.  The scallops were on the hairy edge of being overcooked, the spaghetti squash tasted like it'd been sitting in a bain marie and there were so many capers I found myself picking them out - and I love capers - to lessen the overwhelming saltiness.  A shame.  However, the cookies for dessert were delicious.  Cocktails are expensive too.  Like I said, it's good but it should be great.

EasyToPlease,"Dined on April 3, 2017","For the first time we were disappointed at Heirloom. Though it tends to be a little pricey for us, we usually find the quality of the food justifies it for a special occasion meal. But this time the food was merely OK, perhaps because it was the prix-fixe Restaurant Week menu. The pork confit was definitely too heavy. We splurged on oysters as a first course; they were fine but not the best in town. The real disappointment was the service, which was slow and incompetent. Waiter had trouble opening the wine, which turned out to be a bad bottle anyway. An alternative wine could not be suggested (even by the manager). In the end it took over 20 minutes to be served a bottle of reasonable Cabernet Sauvignon. One of the appetizer orders was botched (leading to further delay), and in the end we were brought the wrong bill for the meal. Though it's a minor point, I found it annoying to have my bread plate cleared before I was done with it -- though other unneeded service items were left on the table until the end of the meal.

Further, the prices would be quite acceptable for food that was really excellent, but it wasn't, so they weren't. In short, over-presented and distinctly average food for a price that can buy far, far better in New Haven.

MPG65,"Dined on February 26, 2017","We had a foursome -- my wife and I were up visiting our son at Yale and took him and his girlfriend out for dinner.   The highlight of the evening was the food.  We had delicious, simple appetizers to start (smoked fish, warm ricotta, etc), but then we ran out of bread and asked for more -- it took more than 10 minutes to get another plate of italian bread.  So the food is excellent, but the theme is spotty service which continued through dinner. Everyone enjoyed their main courses (scallops, lamb ragu, beet risotto) but then toward the end of our meal our server just disappeared.   There was a manager looking guy who came around occasionally but in the end we were finished for 20-30 minutes before we could get our check.  So, really great food, interesting and well priced wine, but I'd say the professionalism of the servers and service (only our waitress spoke english it seemed so other staff couldn't be very helpful) marred the experience.  We'd still go back for the food I think, but with different expectations about how demanding we need to be to get what we want in terms of service. Dinner with wine and tip was $300.

I explained  that I opted for the 130 appointment reservation but it forced me to a 2 o'clock reservation she told me we would have to wait an hour before we were seated my husband then asked what about all the empty tables we are seeing and she said they're all reserved 
She finally seated us about 10 minutes later 
The empty tables we saw were not filled!!
It seems that we were punished for using open table 
We will never go to this restaurant again!!!!

nyfoodie,"Dined on February 19, 2017","Our family of four had Sunday brunch here and was seated at the same time with a huge party next to us. Needless to say we barely saw our waiter after our order was given as he was preoccupied with the large group, which meant our food was delayed. The brunch menu was limited with many over the top options incorporating complicated ingredients. My son has a nut allergy and was told most fried options were cooked in peanut oil. They were good in accommodating  us and cooking his eggs in butter.  I finally ordered a simple breakfast when nothing else seemed appealing.  We frequent farm to table restaurants all the time and felt this place was trying too hard. Though the idea was good, the ingredients should have been a bit more simple.  Nice atmosphere and people but the food was a miss.

Valpogirl,"Dined on February 16, 2017","Let me start with positives: location, food, and ambience. I really like this space and the food has not disappointed in my two visits. 

But here's the negative: During both of my visits, I had Alex as a server. As I only dine here when in town for work, I am alone. This last visit, I opted for a table in the restaurant, which was not full, by the way. Alex never returned to fill my water glass. Not once. I saw other parties of one, and their servers were far more attentive. He, in both instances, has acted as if I was a bother. 

Food is good, the Study is great. But my service experience ensures I won't return.

The decor is lovely and contemporary and the huge windows look out over the street.  We were seated in a corner that was very private.  Our waitress was wonderful.  We wanted to eat slowly so that we just had time together and she was very open to this.  We ordered starters and had the baked ricotta which we loved, the pastry board which was overloaded with amazing pastry that we took home and a great shrimp cocktail.  We were not rushed to order anything else and when we did we all loved our various dishes - chicken salad, burger, salad nicoise - which I was told was the best nicoise ever.  All told, we spent 4+ hours here and were never rushed, waited on perfectly and were able to have great conversation because of the very manageable noise level.  We will definitely go back here.

Lacking,"Dined on February 11, 2017","I have had many positive experiences at Heirloom in the past, maybe 8-10 times it's been exceptional. Last Friday, not so much. I usually enjoy the experience so much that I refer others to check it out and on my last visit  I redeemed a gift card from a friend who appreciated the recommendation. 

The service was very slow. We didn't mind that so much but just to put perspective on it,  it took 45 minutes from our entrees to be cleared for our dessert to be delivered.  15 minutes  plus for drinks on some occasions. Some were 4  minutes which is proper but not the norm on this occasion. 

The octopus was way bland but tender.   My burger?  Usually really exceptional was room temp, lacking horseradish and the Whole G brioche was done no justice. Stale. 

The shrimp cocktail was good not exceptional. My wife liked the scallops and they looked like they were cooked expertly. 

My winter wonderland cocktail was lacking from previous cocktail offerings. 

Lastly the Apple doghnuts, I've had before and they were amazing. They were not on this experience. 


I think I had a bad night, it's usually a good experience.  Last Friday was not.  $180 before tip for 2 people. I'll go back within some time but I'm not in a hurry. 

I would have emailed direct buy your email contact is unavailable on the website.

The menu's sides and salads led us to vastly over-order, which was a disappointment as I was looking forward to dessert. But the entrees were fabulous.  I loved the bouillabaisse; he devoured ample steak with voluminous accompaniments.   The bread was nothing special, and a la carte vegetable sides a bit heavy.   Could use more appealing vegetarian options.

Robert,"Dined on January 13, 2017","The idea for the restaurant (local food) is fine, but the execution was bad. The oyster appetizer had so much hot sauce on each oyster that tasting the overcooked miniscule oysters was impossible. The main courses were overcooked, yet served lukewarm as the gap between cooking and bringing the plates to the table was obviously too great. High prices for poor food. A highlight was the fine wine list.

NewHavenReviewer,"Dined on January 1, 2017","I booked a table for two at Heirloom for New Year's Eve dinner.  My husband had never been to this restaurant, while I had been several times for work and had been impressed with both the food and service.  It was meant to be a special occasion.  I realize it was New Year's Eve, when restaurants may find it difficult to be fully staffed, but I greatly regretted this visit.  The food was average, and the service was poor.  Of the dishes the halibut was the best.  The appetizers were poor: the octopus was rubbery (frozen?) and the oysters so small and flavorless that it seemed we had paid $3 for each little spoonful of tomato garnish.  The duck was tough, and the kale salad dressing so sweet that it wasn't really edible.  As for service, I think the restaurant was really short-staffed.  We asked for another lime half for the appetizers, as the first was one was dessicated that no juice came out.  It never came.  We asked for the salad to come first before the mains, but everything came at the same time.  We kept looking around for a waiter to ask for an extra plate to share the salad, but could never find anyone, so eventually we piled our dirty dishes in the middle of the table and split the salad ourselves.  Because of diabetes, I had asked for no bread crumbs on the salad, but the salad came with bread crumbs all over it anyway.  I didn't realize this until several minutes later.  The next day my blood sugar was the highest it has ever been.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 1, 2017","Like most restaurants attached to hotels, the emphasis is always on the hotel and not the restaurant.  The set-up is okay.  The restaurant is noisy and the food is just okay.  Also, good for when you are stopping in the hotel and do not want to go some place else to eat.
For outsiders, I would say if your intension is to go to a high scale restaurant to have a very good dinner, find another place.  The food is pricey and I do not think it's worth it.  There are very few things on the menu list, no variation.  Good for happy hour or if you are into the drinks and not the food.

eme321,"Dined on December 31, 2016","Quiet when we were there. Two apps: One was a salad that amounted two a large heap of (way too much) cold butternut squash piled on burrata; the other was a warm ricotta cheese dish with focaccia bread. The apps were disproportionately large. Entirely too much squash on the ""salad"" and it was very cold. The ricotta dish has potential to be really good, but again too much cheese for one person. Really you just shouldn't serve that much cheese to one person. Two entrees: Shortribs with grits and Guanciale carbonara. The shortrib dish was excellent. The carbonara was much like eating roasted minced garlic by the spoonful; pasta was done well but way way too much garlic. And I like garlic. Two desserts: cookies and the house special donuts. Cookies were delicious. The donuts were a complete disaster. Server came out to tell us that they were having problems with making the donuts and that it would only be a few more minutes (after 15 minutes already). We ended up getting them to go, and when we got home we looked at them and they were obviously inedible: Completely charred black and essentially raw dough on the inside. Very embarrassing for them. Servers are fantastic. Wine list is exceptional. Decor is very nice for New Haven. Want to like this restaurant and visit again; but our food experience was inconsistent--especially at this price point.

JohnB,"Dined on December 27, 2016","I have highly rated this restaurant for its food and service. It was simply excellent. However, it was part of a hotel and a fire alarm was set off requiring us to depart the dining room waiting 15 minutes for the Fire Department to arrive to disarm the system which continued to blurt loud sounds. Shame on the Fire Department for taking that long. After their departure, a new firm alarm went off and this time it took 20 minutes for the Fire Department to return, the entire time with customers suffering the loud alarm. The restaurant offered a 10% discount, which was, in my opinion, inadequate compensation for the inconvenience. I plan to return, but hope the hotel can do a better job of handling and informing us of what was happening- they also failed here.

We were assured that our servers would be attentive to our theater schedule.  Our food took an hour to arrive from the time we ordered, and we had to inquire twice about why it was taking so long.  We had multiple servers who did not coordinate with each other.  The appetizer was very good and unusual.  The main courses were fair at best.  The branzino entrée was overly salty, almost to a fault.  The roasted cauliflower and broccoli had burned portions, and were floating in grease.  Very disappointing.

We noticed that the manager was on the floor and seemed to be trying to keep things flowing well. Hopefully, due to a number of criticisms of slow and lackluster service, they're trying to improve. I hope they succeed, as the food justifies a better total experience. The butterscotch pudding was great, too!

Our party of 4 had a late-ish reservation (9pm), but we did not expect to be told by our waiter that we would have to order all our courses up-front/at the same time. We, however, complied with this odd request figuring the kitchen might be closing soon. The waiter seemed impatient as he took our drink orders. Perhaps he was frustrated with the bar tender, since the drinks took a long time to arrive. Our shared appetizers, chicken liver mousse and smoked trout were both extraordinarily delicious. And everyone seemed delighted with their Entrees. Apart from the strange behavior of the waiter and slow bar service, I would recommend this chic hotel restaurant, with qualifications.

I will try it again because I have always had wonderful experiences before.

Berryl,"Dined on October 4, 2016","Even better than I'd remembered.
We were thrilled when an out-of-town friend came to stay at The Study Hotel. I gave us a great excuse to return to a favorite restaurant, Heirloom. It had been a while since we'd visited Heirloom, we live on the east side of town, we rarely get to the West Chapel St. neighborhood.

Briefly, the service has become a bit more predictable and professional.  It was fine before but we noticed a bit more polish this visit.  The food and wine list continues to be luscious for a early fall evening.  The Bouillabaisse  was fabulous, as remembered.  The Short Ribs were ""best-in-class"".  I don't even like short ribs but the server's description (given I was in the mood for meat) made me willing to try.  They were DELICIOUS.  Perfect.  The table shared a Caesar Salad, which had some nice twists and was big enough for four.  So. Great to remember why we loved this New Haven gem.  If you have reason to be at The Study or around West Chapel or just want good food in an upscale, urban setting, Heirloom fills the bill.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 2, 2016","The best dishes I tasted were the kale salad and the scallops. Absolutely delicious! Also the side of roasted mushrooms and fries with vinegar aioli were amazing. However, those weren't my dishes so I was just tasting what my family ordered. I would not order the wedge salad again (too much red onion and the serving size is huge- it's not a traditional wedge, it's cut up and all mixed together. The dressing was not great). The ribeye steak had no seasoning (agreed by the whole table) and was under cooked. I requested medium and it was medium rare/rare in some parts but I suppose because it was bone in, it's harder to cook that way. The service was okay, just the bare minimum to take our order and deliver food. No recommendations, no water refills, or offers to bring a second glass of wine. They were very busy and it was hard to get a check at the end of the meal. Overall, I was disappointed because I set the bar high for this restaurant. However, some of the food was good enough to come back for. We will be back on a less busy night when I know the good menu items to order!

We ordered the blistered shishito peppers, the caprese salad and the corn to start. Caprese salad was delicious- the tomatoes were amazing, and the peppers were great. I had the roasted corn gnocchi for dinner which was good, but not fabulous, and my mom had the lamb ragu pappardelle which she was underwhelmed by. We also ordered a bottle of wine, which was very nice, but stored at a temperature that was too warm. We didn't receive the check until 9:30. The food took a long time to come out, even though the restaurant was not even crowded. And the server, while very nice, was not really attentive. I've definitely had better experiences here.

Made for a bit of an awkward way to have a business discussion with another party so close.

If you can, snare a window table do so--which allows you to watch the ever-changing scene on Chapel Street as Yalies, dogs with their owners, and the variety of people that make up New Haven pass by.

Sambal shrimp excellent as was the liver pate. Salmon salad great, lobster Mac too dry and the wedge with chicken has way too much cheese and nuts. The blistered peppers that I live were not cooked long enough. The service was excellent. The pineapple sorbet had literally no flavor and the cookie tulle was stale???

We also had the kale salad (excellent) and the endive nachos (slightly too sweet for my taste but still really really good). TWICE I had the whole grilled Branzino which - with every Carmelized veggie it was lying on, was scrumptious. Our son got a ""chef's choice"" vegan plate and loved it. Everyone was very nice to us.

Noclvrname,"Dined on April 25, 2016","My wife, step-son, who will be starting Yale next month, and I were in New Haven for ""just one more tour"" before me made his decision about where to attend college.   I searched the internet for a ""special"" place for dinner.   Heirloom, regrettably, was not it.  We are committed foodies and have eaten at everything from notable holes-in-the-wall to *** all over the world and all over the United States.  

We had high hopes for Heirloom.  We tried an assortment of dishes and some of them were quite good, especially the appetizers we had.  But the mains were just average to V.G.  The service, while pleasant, was highly disorganized.  We liked our waitstaff.  She was cheerful, knowledgeable and had good intentions.  But there was just a whole lot of purposeless running about by all the waitstaff resulting in overall rather poor service.

Five levels leaves little room for nuance so I elected to rate this restaurant at ""Average"" when in fact it is Good overall, maybe a bit better.  With better service I would have rated it on the low side of Very Good.

That said, my sense of New Haven was that Pizza excepted, one is not likely to find really top restaurants here and perhaps one should not complain about the lower end of Very Good.

The dishes were original, well conceived, and well executed - perfect for the season. The plating was beautiful. We each had an exceptional salad- a take on a Ceasar salad with frisee that was creamy yet light and fresh, and the best kale salad I've ever had, with plump craisins and toasted nuts and perfectly coated with a slightly sweet dressing. My friend had the chicken cutlet dish topped with a savory warm blend of watercress, herbs and shaved Parmesan. I'm usually not a fan of cutlets, but the crust here was expertly done (and was gluten-free by using rice flour). My salmon dish was topped with a spring blend of sprouts and sat in a vegetable mash. The desserts were a delight and very cute served in small Mason jars. My bay leaf infused panna cotta was topped with slightly macerated strawberries, crunchy crumbled cookies, and a dollop of strawberry ice cream - I would go back just for this! Great service too.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 27, 2016","This was not our first visit to Heirloom, so we had expectations for a fine meal for brunch. First, the menu was not as brunch focused as we would have liked, but very creative. We started with the Ploughman's Plate: cured cut meats and cheeses ($26.) which was only OK. No big flavors except for maybe the pate. Husband ordered Niçoise salad with chicken; it arrived with salmon. Once replaced with chicken, he enjoyed the salad, but thought the dressing could have had more flavor. I ordered fish and chips: arrived cold. Soggy breading and cold soggy fries with a tablespoon sized coleslaw (which was not cold and crisp) was not good...at all. Daughter's waffle arrived so cold the butter didn't melt. And who would expect anything but a fluffy Belgian style waffle at this type of establishment? This was flatter than frozen Eggo's. Please note that the restaurant was not extremely busy; there were many empty tables. Service was okay, not great, but the waiter did take the waffle off the bill (I hadn't mentioned my disappointment with the fish and chips).

This was truly an unsatisfactory meal. I expected more from having had nice meals at Heirloom before! It is a nice atmosphere .

The service was good and the waitress was very courteous to my mom, who is elderly and had numerous questions about the menu. The food- well there were some problems. The burrata starter was excellent but it kind went down hill after that.  The soups were under-seasoned. The fries were cold and would have been delicious had they been served hot. I had the kale frittata and it was really boring.  My husband's rueben was good but the corned beef was very fatty.  I think sticking to the bagels & such might have been a better idea.  However, the desserts were fantastic. The cheesecake & apple cider donuts were amazing. 
The dining room is lovely and it tickled me that they were playing Funny Girl on the TV. We didn't have any drinks outside of tea & coffee, which were very good.

The menu is seafood-heavy, although there are enough options to avoid it if you don't like seafood. Dishes are decently portioned, well-presented, and very strongly flavored - every one is different! The charred broccoli with maple, miso and white soy was intensely sweet and savory. The scallop entree features three plump, succulent scallops on a healthy bed of spaghetti squash. The kale salad was topped with an unreal sour cherry vinaigrette. It's very wood-toned and dim in the dining room but with a lively noise level. Overall just a really nice spot.

We shared the ""Ploughman's Plate"" and the truffles ricotta and both were plenty for the 4 of us and quite good.  The goat cheese was particularly notable.  For entrees, we had the scallops, chicken and bouillabaisse.  The scallops were perfectly done, with a glazed squash and the chicken was excellent.  The bouillabaisse was a huge portion, and the seafood well cooked and fresh.  We will go back again, anxious to try the regular menu.

I normally skip bread but made an exception and it was well worth it. The horseradish butter was novel and very good. I had a marvelous and huge chicken cutlet with bitter greens. I started with the kale salad. Both were exceptional. The waiter confused my order and thought I had the salmon so my food took a while to be prepared but the manager came over and immediately worked on making it right. We all chose different desserts and sampled them all. They were wonderful. We also had the Ploughman's plate appetizer and glad we only ordered the half portion. The meats and cheeses were delicious. Over all a lovely dining experience and we will return.

When I arrived there I was informed I was a few minutes late and couldn't be seated at all, then they relented and said I could be seated at the bar, and that all 2 p.m. lunch reservations are bar seating, not table service. This should have been made clear when I made the reservation. And I felt I was spoken to rudely or at the very least condescendingly. I've eaten there before, and they're not that good to display that kind of attitude.

Two food selections were delicious, with the third only good. My friends had the frittata  and the brioche French toast. The frittata, made with egg whites, was moist and fluffy.  The brioche French toast was more like dessert than breakfast--very sweet, topped with ice cream. Although it would have been too sweet for me, my friends loved it. My ham and eggs were tasty, but the asparagus was undercooked, which detracted from the taste. Somehow, the flavors did not meld. Overall, a delightful experience with some misses.

Ricotta gnocchi was the definition of gnocchi: little perfect pillows. Scallops perfectly seared and spaghetti squash perfectly seasoned. Waiter Omar was kind and attentive, friendly and professional. Even the sides were astonishing. I could happily eat the gunpowder mushrooms faulty for the rest of my life. And as I said to my dining companion, ""This is what God has in mind when broccoli was created."" The blueberry crisp was perfectly balanced, and the sole donuts were out of this world--warm and crisp on the outside, soft and chewy in, with perfect sugary sweetness. I will definitely be back.

Service was brisk and a touch impersonal.   It wasn't crowded and it would've been nice to have a recommendation or two from the bartenders.   When we moved to our table the waiter was friendly and realized we were going to take a while as we were chatting and catching up.  He was accommodating.  The bread and horseradish spread was wonderful and the food that came out was lovely as well. The burger looked perfect, I had the clam risotto, which was over salted, but tasty and well cooked.   We also shared the lamb sausage pappardelle which had delicious, spicy flavor, and finally the scallops on spaghetti squash which was also delicious but over-salted. We were stuffed. So, we ordered dessert!!!  The coffee was perfection and we shared the homemade cookies with a ramekin of warm buttercream frosting.  The cookies were amazing- the frosting sweet and creamy, but we all felt it was a cream cheese and not buttercream flavor.  Good nonetheless.  No cookie crumbs left on our plates (frosting remained virtually untouched).  I'd go back again without question and would love to try brunch next time.   The atmosphere was wonderful and it's great to see a varied menu and wine list at affordable prices in a space with quality service and kitchen talent.

As per usual I found them online and the convenience of booking reservations via the Internet is just the greatest thing since sliced bread.

This is the first restaurant I have walked into where your reserved table had a written thank you and welcome note waiting for you on arrival. What a phenomenal touch. Such a simple yet powerful message that screams; ""we want your business and are glad you chose us""...

My Iceberg Wedge salad with its chunks of beets and bacon was Devine... Not served the way most restaurants do but laid out flat with the toppings on top... My wife's appetizer with its arugula, prosciutto, fresh mozzarella set the stage for the main event...

The chefs surprise of bread served with a warm ricotta cheese, thyme and truffle was a wonderfully unexpected surprise... The trouble was it's really good and I don't want to fill up before the main course comes out...

The salmon was absolutely perfect... Cherry Wood Roasted Organic salmon... Served with Quinoa, asparagus, radish, sugar snap peas apple & dill, maple-carrot ginger citronette... Amazing! 

Although I don't Ordinarily Oder scallops for a main course but the description sounded really great. Cooked to perfection accompanied by a generous helping of caramelized spaghetti squash, sage, capers, citrus and sultanas. It was plated so well I almost felt bad eating it...

For dessert we shares a pear cobbler with a generous helping of ice cream. The pear was nice and soft, cooked to perfection in a flaky pastry served nice and warm. Simply amazing! 

You need to add this place as a stop on your gastronomic bucket list. I highly recommend it!

My only complaint is that the portion is a bit small--you get three medium-sized falafel balls. The menu item was not in the ""snacks/light lunch"" section, so I was expecting a bit more food.

divedog,"Dined on December 21, 2014","We have dined at Heirloom about five times in the past and were a little concerned about some reviews that suggested the quality has slacked off. We had a table of five and everyone ordered something different and everyone was happy with their choices. The price was reasonable (albeit not cheap) considering the quality of the food, the attentive but inobtrusive service, and the pleasant ambiance. The only criticism we had was the dish that was billed as Bouillabaisse but was actually more like a Thai curry! It still tasted good but it definitely was not the famous French dish. It's things like that that keep this from being a five star but I think it rates four stars. I still think that Heirloom and Union League are the two best restaurants in New Haven.

We were also tickled to see Steve Martin on the way out ... he was headed off to see a production of his play ‘Picasso at the Lapin Agile’ at Long Wharf (where we were headed as well) and he graced the audience with some reflections during the talk-back after the show.

NHFoodie,"Dined on December 14, 2014","I was quite disappointed with my last dining experience at Heirloom. I remembered really enjoying the food in the past and so invited two friends from the city to join my husband and I for brunch there. We all ordered different dishes and everyone had the exact same reaction: ""it's very bland."" I felt embarrassed since I had talked the place up. For the price and philosophy, one expects much higher quality, a foodie's treat -- the result was anything but. I'm crossing Heirloom off my list.

I was told that the secret is toasted tomatoes.  The noise level can be high when the restaurant is crowded but that adds to the city vibe, especially when seated at a window.

kronickwino,"Dined on November 6, 2014","Love Heirloom at The Study hotel. In fact, I always forget it's there. We enjoyed the upscale atmosphere - very posh - loved the food which was fresh and seasonal. The wine list fits the menu which is always a plus. I love that you have a great view of the street life from the bar and there is tons of comfy seating. Restaurant week menu was a delight and very well priced for the quality. Downsides I would put here are the lighting was VERY dark. I'm 34 and I almost couldn't read the menu! And the service was a bit lacking: i.e. we ordered white wine and no ice bucket. Servers were clearing dishes in the middle of enjoying our entrees, someone's knife was taken right in front of them. Water service was lacking. Otherwise, love the place!

LydiaA,"Dined on October 22, 2014","I'm a New Yorker with access to world-class restaurants, but I dearly love Heirloom, especially the fantastic branzino with romenesco sauce.  It is the best dish ever! I also love the kale salad, burratta,  warm herby ricotta, horseradish spread served with warm bread, and all the vegetables.  My two sons swear by the hamburger. Our whole family loves Heirloom and we eat here every chance we get.  New Haven has some very good restaurants, but we think Heirloom is the only great one.  That being said, the service, while friendly, can be a tad slow, so be forewarned if you're aiming for the 8:00 curtain at the Rep.  It can be noisy, but cheerful, by the bar, but you can ask for a seat towards the back if you prefer, where it's much quieter.

Re the chicken...""it takes a long time""  Well, I would expect to be warned if anything was going to take an hour!
When the chicken came, it looked like it had been pan fried...that could never take an hour! It was OK but I was so full of bread by then that I could not finish it. Nothing special about it.We were offered free desserts to make up for the wait. We accepted that but the dessert was too sweet with no nuance of flavor.The restaurant was cold, so dress accordingly.

Our waiter/waitress never arrived--we sat at our table listening to the drunk women sing--for 10+ minutes. We finally asked the waiter helping the drunk women if he was our waiter,  he said no but he took our order and then helped us a few more times. If we had a waitstaff member assigned to us, s/he never helped us (maybe it was the woman who brought the check?). Thankfully, the food was amazing.

Last Sunday night however it took a long time to get the food out of the kitchen.  The place was not overcrowded.  We had had substantial appetizers, so we weren't starving, but the delay was still irksome and unexplained -- we ordered nothing fancy or off-menu.  It makes me wonder whether it was just an off-night in the kitchen, or whether they are understaffed in the summer or what.  The food was good when it came, but we had waited too long for it to enjoy it as much as we would have, had it been brought out promptly.

If the restaurant if providing flashlights to the guests to read the menu why not raise the lighting level even a little?  The food is pretty good for New Haven, but both the food and service could use much improvement:  the food is often too salty and some dishes are served on wooden boards which are completely impractical for eating on (food falls off entirely).  Other dishes are not served on functional dishes as well.  The service can be extremely slow- very unpredictable.  We have received a complimentary dish in the past to compensate for the service, but we prefer better service!  Also, the waitstaff should wait until all diners have finished eating before taking away plates.

The new menu item -- risotto with grass, sticks, and hay, or what they called asparagus, peas, and favs beans -- just felt like the wrong kind of grazing. A sheep I am not. Also, horseradish in the butter served with rolls was an unwelcome surprise.

KESD,"Dined on March 22, 2014","We had a wonderful dinner at Heirloom on Friday! The restaurant was busy and fun, and food was fantastic! The duck and fois gras meatballs were UNREAL! I have an allergy to soy, and find it hard to find restaurants that are comfortable with that, but Heirloom was because they are cooking high-quality food and know their ingredients. I had the steak and fries (cooked in peanut oil, rather than soy), and the steak was perfectly cooked with a delicious bearnaise crust (and I admit, I took home enough for a whole second meal!). Heirloom is pricey, but absolutely worth it, and my husband and I will head back as often as we can! Even if we don't have a lot of time, we will head there for a drink and some of those AMAZING fries!!

It was peaceful, almost serene tho the wait staff told us it gets noisy when crowded - we were there early pre-theater. Fine menu with excellent choices for everyone. Emphasis on fresh farm & sea to table which we prefer. Kale salad was gummy as was my fresh swordfish, a friend's bouillabaisse, my husband's steak frites and the another friend's branzino. Skipped desserts but next time for sure.

From grilled octopus and baked ricotta for apps to bouillabaisse and hamburger entrees, it was only okay. Unfortunately, the hamburger ordered medium came out so rare and while the bouillabaisse broth was flavorful, the seafood wasn't. Even the plate iof warm cookies was only ok, lacking that home baked freshness. Would recommend but not terrific food.

They are trying to be inventive with things, adding little twists to recipes but it doesn't work, such as my risotto. Burnt toast at breakfast. Service is poor: long stretches between courses, no bread provided till we realized it was available ( at end of our meal), lukewarm coffee ( difficult to get refills). Plates either too big for small portions or too large for table. Very displeasing place.

Deviled egg with French bread perfectly seasoned. Smoked trout was good but very salty. A nice selection of wines by the glass. The only downside to the experience was the VERY slow service, so take that into consideration if you have somewhere else to be after your meal. On the flip side, when we realized that the waitress had brought the wrong smoked trout dish (there were two on the menu), she very willingly took back the enormous kale salad we had ordered but realized we would not be able to eat, and she took the salad off our bill.

Disappointed,"Dined on February 2, 2014","Had brunch here last Sunday because our daughter chose the place. Have to say- there are many better places in and around New Haven to have brunch. Food is overpriced and pretentious, and with three of us- two orders came out at the same time (one cold and needed to be sent back) and the third (pancakes) came later, and then without syrup. Really? You can't get three orders out at the same time? Service was awful, despite the fact that we had a reservation, so they were clearly expecting us. It's a snazzy place, but I'm not impressed by smoke and mirrors. Provide good food, full of taste, and good service, and you will win my vote.

Each dish maintained distinct flavors. Portions were very nice. ( generous compared to some pretentious joints, but what I call right for the price ). I only wished i ate less dinner because- The desserts were AMAZING. I would never have picked the butterscotch pudding but our waiter recommended it. One bite and I thought I had died and gone to heaven.
The ambience is very trendy but warm. I loved wandering the Study halls afterwards to check out the art show on display by Yale. Possibly a little loud for some but we loved it for a saturday night celebration. Great experience.

Warm, elegant decor elevated the restaurant to the appropriate 'special occasion' status, and the staff knows it. Our hostess was kind and accommodating, while our waitstaff made us feel very tended-to and important. Given the ambiance, I expected the menu to be much steeper than it was and was surprised and relieved at the bill. Everything was delicious, particularly the bouillabaisse, which was first-rate, with fresh, delicious crustaceans in a delicious saffron-seasoned broth, At least two can share this dish and be well-satisfied. They also offered very good choices to my very picky 11 year old.

GBNB,"Dined on November 20, 2013","We live in New Haven and have dined at most of the downtown restaurants. We had previously been to Heirloom for brunch, but not for dinner.

Unfortunately, the food was pretty bad, especially given the price points. For appetizers we had the smoked octopus and the baked clams. The clams were ok, but the octopus was overcooked, chewy, and way over seasoned. The sauce on the octopus was congealed.

For mains, we had steak frites and pasta with lamb ragu. The steak was the right temp, but the blue cheese sauce was very heavy handed. The lamb ragu sauce had an off flavor.

The bill was $130, including two glasses of wine. Much better food at similar prices can be had at Ibiza, Barcelona, and Zinc-- all within 50 yards of the hotel.

They didn't give us our appetizers for 45min, and when food came it was our mains. We got mac and cheese, and one of them was missing the breadcrumbs on top entirely. We sent them back, and finally the appetizers came after another 10min (they seemed to have forgotten). The moment we were done with the appetizers they whisked it away and put down our mains, and it was clear it was the exact same two dishes as before, because of the missing bread crumbs and also because it was cold.

For lunch, 30 minutes after my friend and I put in our lunch order, they came with our ""main courses"" even though we hadn't even gotten our appetizers yet. We notified the server, who didn't apologize and instead just said that he would ""find out"" what was going on. One of the mains was what my friend ordered and the other was not what I ordered, so we sent the ""wrong"" dish back. Turns out, our two foods were meant for another table.

- Warm ricotta (creamy and warm with white truffle oil)

Dinners:
- Corn gnocchi (light and refreshing, perfect for summer)
- Scallops (big, meaty scallops with a tangy sauce)

Dessert:
I was a little disappointed that my favorite dessert at Heirloom - the pot de creme – wasn't on the menu. But we found things to indulge in:
- warm cookies
- salted caramel gelatto

It was a perfect evening. Our server was great and attentive

DiningDads,"Dined on August 11, 2013","We left Heirloom with a really good impression. The 1/2 ploughman's platter had a good assortment of really interesting cured meats, a different flavor profile than one might be used to, the cheese was all mild (good for me) and very tasty. The roast octopus was to-die-for. It was triple cooked to a very tender state, not mushy as some had reviewed. We ordered the scallops on caramelized spaghetti squash and the sea bass on zucchini ribbons in a lighter cool buttermilk corn cream sauce with a hint of acid that gave it an edge. The fish was cooked perfectly, with a thin seared crust on top. If anything, it could have had a hint more seasoning to it but that could have ruined the fine sauce. Lighting could be a bit brighter.

PaulCT,"Dined on August 4, 2013","Our meal was a complete fail. Appetizers of grilled octopus (mushy, swimming in bland oil) and clams (small, rubbery, topped with an excruciatingly salty dry breading) were disastrous. Better at the frozen food section at Stop n Shop. We made the mistake of ordering the charred strip steak, mine medium and my wife's medium rare. The meat was low quality, thin, grisly, and both were way over-done with any hint of char on the outside. At least the wine was not affected. Our waitress was very nice, and I suspect it an poorly supervised kitchen that was the culprit.

Given the praise some of the reviews have given, my only comment is, New Haven natives need to go to NY once in a while.

While we waited almost 30 minutes for our first course to come out, we watched a table next to us (who had sat a few minutes after us) receive and finish their entire meal. The server asked if she could clear our plates while we still had a few bites left because our next course was ready and she wanted to bring it out. The rest of the food that came out was poorly prepared, under seasoned, and completely uninspired. Our server was apathetic and unfamiliar with the menu. Even though there were only a few other people in the restaurant by the time we left, we felt completely ignored the entire time.

The waiter then placed an empty wine glass at my companion's setting but had to be reminded to bring the wine. Half an hour later, a different server delivered our food with a flourish; unfortunately the wrong order was delivered to me and my partner's shrimp and grits was served lukewarm.

Thr pate was excellent, but the ""seven vegetables"" salad was the worst salad I've ever had at a good restaurant -- flavorless, soggy. It's true that it looked beautiful on the plate, but it needed a dressing with some taste (and some vinegar!) and crisper, more flavorful vegetables (carrot and cucumber slices are seldom a good combination!). The arugula on the winter caprese was crish and fresh....but the food here was a big disappointment. Neverthe I will give it one more try -- and hope some of the other dishes are as good as the pate.

I googled the restaurant and called and got the hotel instead. The gal there would not transfer me to the hostess stand (I asked) but did helpfully tell me she would take my name and phone number and the restaurant would get back to me. Later that afternoon I still had heard nothing so sent a message through a friend of a friend so to speak and was told ""Yes, you can come at 6:30!""

The food was great, as per usual, our server as well. Open Table...quite confusing. If I had been from out of town, I would have gone to another restaurant. Pretty sure Heirloom would be unhappy.

The waitstaff is not properly trained or supervised. Food was brought o the table and auctioned off - ""who ordered the soup! the salad, etc?"" I had to go into the waiter's pantry to get a soup spoon. We were well into eating the entree before the waiter asked how everything was.

One diner who isn't into soups even found it delicious, albeit with a strong dairy flavor at the end. Hanger steak with farro was cooked perfectly at medium rare. Too stuffed to eat much dessert but ordered the apple cider doughnuts anyway. Very light batter, lightly stuffed with pieces of apple. More of a fritter than a doughnut but still very tasty.

The menu is always intriguing, featuring fresh, local, seasonal ingredients. The sea scallop entree in particular is always amazing, and is truly a destination dish. However, there is a tendency with other dishes to be somewhat heavy-handed with seasoning, to the point that salt or other strongly flavored herbs or spices take over the dish, and food is sometimes cold. Service is generally good, and always very pleasant, but sometimes the waiter can disappear for stretches. The ambiance is great, feeling far more like NYC than New Haven.

However, ""slow"" does not accurately describe the service the night four of had dinner before the show at Yale Rep. We arrived at 6:00, told both the hostess and our waiter of our need to be out to make the show. All went well at first. First courses arrived in a timely fashion. And then . . . nothing, until our waiter reappeared around 7:00 to ask how we were doing. Since there was no food on the table, it seemed clear we weren't doing too well. We reminded him of our time constraints and he assured us food would be out momentarily. It arrived at 7:20. We were amazed that in a restaurant with truly splendid food, the service could be so bad.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 12, 2012","This is one of my favorite places to eat in New Haven. The food is always wonderful. We just had lunch there and I ordered the New England chopped salad which was made with wheatberries. Outstanding. Highly recommend. My husband and son ordered the French toast and raved about it but I'm counting calories. For breakfast the egg white omelet with mixed greens was very tasty. We also stopped by for dessert and all loved the butterscotch pudding. We have eaten here many times and never had a bad meal. The service is always kind.

Contemporary decor with upbeat atmosphere, yet tables spaced far enough apart making it condusive for business or more intimate conversation. Friendly and attentive server. Menu selections very creative with an interesting mix of ingredients that worked well together. All delicious. We will definately go back again.

Fine,"Dined on October 1, 2012","As in our past experiences at Heirloom, the food was very good, the dining room very pleasant, and the service was adequate, but a bit uneven. The wait staff are often very attentive at the beginning of one's visit, but sometimes become scarce as the meal progresses, even when there are relatively few people dining.

We were the first and only people in the dining room when the restaurant opened, and the waiter informed us that they ""are out of the lobster risotto"". Considering that there was no one there, who could have ordered the dish, we were amused, and thought the waiter might have said: ""The lobster risotto is not being offered this evening.""

All in all, the entrees and desserts were excellent, and we will return to Heirloom

Momster,"Dined on September 30, 2012","Very expensive for the quality of the food. The restaurant was very dark. We arrived in time for a 6:00PM reservation because we were going to the theater. It was so dark that we requested a table near the window. They were immediately accomodating. The antipasto was ordinary w/ the ham difficult to cut and eat. I had the strip steak and it was tasty but loaded w/ fat and grizzle. One companion had three vegetables for her main course, but they were overcooked and the broccoli rabe went uneaten. The hamburger was unexciting and ordinary. The chicken was also tasty but pale and unappetizing.

LindaR,"Dined on September 18, 2012","We went there to celebrate a birthday. The food was flawless, the service attentive but not too much. We started with the kale salad which was not overly blanched and not overly dressed. A light lemony dressing along with some hazelnuts made it ideal. It was also big enough to share which they offered to do. We ordered some crostini and the server arrived with extra toppings on the house.
We both had the lobster risotto which did not disappoint. Hunks of lobster, soft but juicy rice and complex imaginative additions of lemon, zaatar and pickled ginger made this lobster risotto the opposite of some of the bland locally available renditions. The pile of raw pea shoots went perfectly. And no room for dessert. We will return.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 17, 2012","What a gem! We started with the roasted octopus, and a half-dozen bluepoint oysters. The octopus was outstanding and totally unique. The oysters were full of ocean freshness. We both decided on the roasted duck with mushrooms and roasted artichokes which was perfectly prepared and the gently fried duck egg on top was a classic touch.

The lighting is a bit subdued for reading the menu and fully appreciating the presentation, and the noise level is really more ""lively"" (louder than ""moderate"", but not quite ""energetic"") . . . a bit of sound deadening couldn't hurt.

All in all, this has to be one of the most surprisingly ""WOW"" restaurant finds I have had in quite a while.

I LOVE the vibe, decor and feel of Heirloom. I will also say that parts of the food were amazing but parts really missed. The deviled egg salad starter was too liquidy and the ""toast"" that comes with it was cold and stale (as was the basket). I also had to ask for bread plates only after our starters were served. I also had to ask for Jam and the server oddly removed the bread moments after it had arrived prior to our meals. My boyfriend asked for a salad instead of fries (but fries came - which were good), and my frittata was good, the hamburger was great and the banana's foster french toast was amazing.

I had the Ricotta Gnocci, which turned out to be large balls of cheese, somewhat melted, in a sauce that definitely tasted jarred. My partner had the Roast Chicken which was very bland and unseasoned with undercooked root vegetables. Very disappointing since the spot has potential to be a great restaurant. Our first visit to this restaurant was when they first opened, and had kinks to work out. Our second visit was about a year ago, and the food was 50/50, but after this we won't be back.

We especially loved the chopped winter salad of kale and a cherry vinagrette that was not sweet! The mussels in a lobster bisque were the plumpest and juiciest I have ever had. The other dishes didn't distinguish themselves, but everything was excellent. BUT the dining room was incredibly noisy, probably due to the glass wall and the high ceilings. The ceiling should have noise-dampening material installed. I gave the service 4 stars because the waitress, who was pleasant enough and attentive, never asked if we were finished w/our meal and unceremoniously plopped the bill on the table as she walked by.

The food was good. Despite the poor attention we received from wait-staff and hostess, we agreed that we liked the food and setting enough to try coming back again to give a second chance.

The service was perfect, I VERY RARELY say this, but it really hit the perfect sweet spot between attentive and pushy. Timed just right and never when we were in the middle of a bite or obviously lingering over our wine. Hands down though the most outstanding part of the meal was the dessert!!! At first glance I wasn't too excited about the dessert menu - I asked a few questions and settled on the reccomended Butterscoth pudding and the apple caramel donuts for my husband. The desserts were OUTSTANDING. The Pudding and its acrutraments, trancendent! I would go back for the dessert alone! I will be attempting to make this at home!!!

The focus on local food is much appreciated and well-executed.  This visit was remarkable because of the service (second time this has happened).  My friend and I were visiting and gabbing and eating and drinking slowly...the restaurant was busy but there was no line...and our server indulged us with perfect service, making sure we had what we needed, when we needed it without ever making us feel rushed.  Thank you Heirloom---this is a treasure in New Haven.

We had an early dinner reservation & service was quite good, almost TOO good. Since we had 4 servers & it was slow they kept asking us the same questions...might better consider assigning stations so as to avoid these continuous interruptions. We were also were being asked if everyhting was OK split moments after just having been served a course...a bit overkill... :)

Interesting menu with interesting/unusual combinations of vegetables, herbs and sauces. Duck sausage was fabulous as were the sea scallops. Kale salad was good but needed to be ""kicked up a notch"" flavor-wise. Octopus appetizer was very good. Service was generally good; just a bit slow initially when restaurant wasn't overly busy.

WilliamK,"Dined on October 1, 2011","The service and food were excellent. Heirloom takes local grown produce and meats and creates imaginative dishes that still maintain the best qualities of traditional presentations. The option of ordering ""table snacks"" is a nice addition to a selection of appetizers. The shellfish appetizers (shrimp cocktail and oysters) were excellent! It is nice to see that the dessert menu includes a ""cookie plate"" as well as a choice of gelatos and sorbettos, and not just overly rich selections. Having visited this restaurant several times, we have found that the service has varied, but this time, it was very efficient and our server was accommodating and friendly without being obtrusive.

We held high hopes for this spot as the service is quite pleasant and the dining room very attractive.

The sauteed wild bass had a cucumber gazpacho sauce with mint, zucchini and asparagus. The gnocchi was light and airy with a corn, ricotta, tomato, basil, chives, scallion and scape sauce.

OK--I'm not someone who EVER cares about service. I just don't--I go out to eat to enjoy good food, and I don't care whether my waiter is attentive, or rude, or whatever. In fact, I almost never notice if the service is subpar. But trust me, I notice every time we go to Heirloom. The service is downright atrocious--and if you're someone who cares about that, don't go--you'll hate it.

First, the absolutely delicious french toast has been erroneously removed from the menu. I asked our waitress, ""Lauren F"", and she rudely told me that the chef changes the menu seasonally. I then proceeded to ask what has been added since they removed our favorite dish? Hoping that she would politely point out on the menu the new additions. Instead, she abruptly told me that she didn't know and that she usually doesn't work brunch. Then they lost one of our meals - which the manager apologized for and removed from our check.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 27, 2011","Heirloom has high aspirations that it fails to meet. Service was (aside from the bartender) not very friendly and as amateurish as the first time I visited, over a year ago. Food was delivered at seemingly random times - my salad (an appetizer; definitely not a dinner accompaniment) was delivered to the table with my entree. Food was uniformly over-salted and awash in butter. We all know that the first trick to restaurant cooking is LOTS of salt and butter, but it's not much of a trick if anyone can taste it from a mile away. The menu items sound interesting and that can't be said for a great number of restaurants in town, but they don't deliver. Just totally unpolished and not very good.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 20, 2011","The food at Heirloom is the attraction. Imaginative, organic, local ingredients put together perfectly. Every food item we had was perfect. We found ourselves saying ""how did they do that?"" and ""what's in this?""- as the ingredients married perfectly. Any fodie in New Haven should try Heirloom. The negatives were few, although service sometime lagged (there was a large party) and some servers seemed sullen, almost miserable.

Nice, compact, interesting wine list too.

The good ponts: We had an unrushed visit; The décor is modern and comfortable; The food - just good, not great.
The bad points: The service and the price. The service was the worst we've experienced in a long time - feel free to contact me for details - and certainly not what one would expect for a breakfast that cost $92 for 4 people having a simple entrée each, four side orders of sausage or bacon, three pots of tea, one glass of orange juice, and one Bloody Mary

Definitely think the servers (we had at least 2) dropped the ball a little bit. It wasn't busy, but we barely saw our server and I had to flag someone down to get another beer. If it was super busy night I'm fine w/ that, but it seemed like there were a lot of people standing around who could have spent their time better enhancing our meal (and increasing the check average.)

They have an eclectic drinks menu, and a dinner menu mixed with solid staples (hanger steak, mac and cheese) and imaginative dishes (gnocchi w/ lamb sausage, shrimp & skate, butternut purée). We ate at the bar on a quiet Monday, so the service may be reflective of that, but it was friendly, attentive, and helpful. I'm sure on a busier night Heirloom would be even better.

It was pretty early (11:30am) so the restaurant was pretty empty and so I was especially disappointed in the poor service. My friend was served tea in a teapot without a cup twice in that one lunch, and our waiter was always nowhere to be found whenever we needed something. It took another hour between when we finished our meal till when we could leave because the check took so long (they didn't give us the check when we asked for it, and then they didn't take our cards when we gave it to them, etc). The dessert also took half an hour to make, which was really too long. The tuna melt I had was not spectacular either, and I expected a lot more from Heirloom.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 20, 2010","Heirloom does an excellent job of dispelling the myths of hotel restaurants. It's in the Study Hotel, but it's outstanding. The hotel is a boutique offering for the Yale area. That vibe and design esthetic carries over to Heirloom with a sleek bar and modern dining room.

To start, the wine list is great, but the prices go up quickly. Stay with the respectable low end options and save money for the food.

Warm ricotta dip is insanely good. It's a savory version of dessert before the meal, but it's worth it.

Definitely try the scallops served over spaghetti squash with sage and raisins. So good!

Service was attentive, pleasant, and knowledgeable. True to the scholar environs, the

The fish fritters tasted like, well, nothing. The haddock with artichokes also managed to be bland. Now I do not like spicy, salty, or over-flavored food, so when I say bland, I mean bland.

Beef ""cheeks"" were extremely tender, and a bit more tasty.

A nice night out, and the food is acceptable. I will go back, but if the food is the same at their regular prices, which are rather high in comparison to other area restaurants, that will be the last time.

The pannacotta had at least 4-5 times the amount of gelatin in it than it should have. No joke: you could drop the tip of a spoon into it from 5 inches and it would bounce off. Even worse was the service--we waited (at our reservation time) at the front desk for 10 minutes before someone from the hotel staff had to come over and seat us. Service was slow and spotty throughout, and we waited for 30 minutes(!!) between the entree and dessert, for dishes that are pretty much pre-made.

Dining companion raved about kale-""best ever had."" My risotto was a little too much-over cheesed, over salted ( I love salty), for me, but the texture was perfect. My kid devoured it and I definitely helped. House wines definitely 'cheap', but smartly chosen-Cupcake Sav Blanc was completely drinkable. Rest of wine list looked interesting. Atmosphere comfortable, open. Back more intimate, front, giant floor-to-ceiling windows. Since it's in a hotel lobby, there were plenty of interesting places for my kid to go to take a break from the adults at the table.

Toasted bread with olive oil served cold each time - must be on purpose. Menu and what arrived differed and again, very kindly and attentive staff but completely uninformed about what they're serving. Didn't know which cheese was which, called prosciutto pancetta, etc. For a restaurant that charges these prices and is wanting to take part in the farm-to-table movement, would like to see them train their staff and fill out their menu with accurate info.

My main course of scallops was sparse (three large scallops and a puree of peas with a few slices of figs) was expensive and good but not overwhelming. My dessert (brownie with ice cream) was quite good. My dining companions did not luck out as well. The salad came undressed and we had to ask for the dressing. The duck was ok - not great. The cheesecake was horrible - one of the most bland things I've ever tasted in my life. The sorbet was boring. And the spinach side was quite good but really expensive for the tiny serving. Service was ok - not great, not offensive. Ambiance:nice. No need for any of us to return.

The seafood pasta, an appetizing dish in writing, failed--pasta and lemongrass undercooked, seafood over cooked. The hanger steak, however, was delicious. The mesclun salad was overdressed but the flavors, especially the lemon vinaigrette, complemented each other well. A little more attention to detail (and lower prices) could make The Study one of New Haven's great restaurants.

Very bright and open however, except for the bar, it's one very large room. That takes away from the ambiance I think. We thoroughly enjoyed the crabcake & fries for an appetizer and the wine menu was quite extensive. We both ended up ordering the haddock with pureed artichoke.....the haddock was a little overdone but the flavor almost made up for that. We then shared an apple tart for dessert which was different but quite nice. I didn't find the prices to be overwhelming as I had read on one comment but there were only 7 choices for entrees which I thought was strange.

Service staff must have been watching a ballgame somewhere else. They certainly were not attentive - or even in sight most of the time. The sorbet advertised with a Florentine cookie came naked, and after that was pointed out to the waitress, she eventually came back with a plate of Amaretto cookies explaining ""we ran out of the others.""

Either the restaurant caters to an affluent clientele seeking super-boring food, or the chef and cooks are timid and intimidated by/ignorant of flavor and spice. I was very disappointed.

Frustrating because if the kitchen is capable of producing great food, which it did, then sending out bland, underseasoned food doesn't mean that you're not a good cook. It means that either you don't care, or you're not paying attention & tasting your food all the time. Most of the food was great, but there were lots of lapses.

Steak frites: good but not hot enough. Ham mac n' cheese: bland & overly oniony. Bacon wrapped dates: phenomenal. Crab cake: a little burnt and sort of tasty. Mesclun salad: solid, not spectacular. Short ribs with cheddar polenta and roasted veggies: bland, bland, bland (sent it back). Gnocchi: great. Beignets: amazing. Ginger cake: very good. Confusing, huh?

Heirloom (why this name? there is nothing to suggest an antique, a family treasure or a smidgen of memorabilia) should be an instant hit: a smart, stylish destination among a thong of lusterless dining establishments.
